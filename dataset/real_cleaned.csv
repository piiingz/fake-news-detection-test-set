The protest will challenge an Internal Revenue Code restriction that limits the political activities of charitable organizations – including churches and other religious groups – that are exempt from taxation. According to the Internal Revenue Code, religious groups may lose their tax-exempt status if they officially endorse a political candidate. The ADF says that if its protest leads the Internal Revenue Service to penalize houses of worship for their pastors’ political advocacy, ADF will bring a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of these penalties. To discuss the ADF protest and IRS restrictions on the political activities of religious organizations, the Pew Forum turns to church-state scholar Robert W. Tuttle. Featuring: Robert W. Tuttle, David R. and Sherry Kirschner Berz Research Professor of Law and Religion, The George Washington University Law School Interviewer: Jesse Merriam, Research Associate, Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life Question & Answer Before 1954, section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code permitted nonprofit organizations to endorse political candidates while remaining exempt from federal income tax. But in 1954, the U.S. Congress amended this part of the code to say that a charitable organization loses its tax-exempt status if it intervenes in a political campaign. Why did Congress add this restriction? Many members of Congress, including Lyndon B. Johnson, a senator at the time, voted for the amendment because they were concerned about nonprofit organizations funding their opponents’ political campaigns. But because there was little debate over the amendment or how it would influence churches, we don’t know precisely why Congress enacted the amendment. Notably, the 1954 amendment is often misunderstood as limiting political advocacy, but the rule’s actual purpose has to do with political contributions. Under the Internal Revenue Code, there are many different kinds of tax-exempt organizations. For example, section 527 of the code exempts all sorts of political organizations from federal income tax. But organizations that qualify as charitable groups under section 501(c)(3) are special because donors to these organizations may deduct their contributions from their own federal income taxes. So a primary purpose of the 1954 amendment was to prevent donors from deducting political contributions from their taxes. Why is the Alliance Defense Fund so interested in eliminating this restriction? The ADF opposes the restriction because the rule requires churches to choose between actively participating in political campaigns, on the one hand, and accepting tax-deductible donations, on the other hand. As a result, if a church wanted to promote or oppose a particular political candidate, the church would be required to create a separate organization to do so. Although this separate organization would be exempt from taxes, contributors could not take a tax deduction for their donations to this organization. The ADF believes that this restriction takes political activity out of the heart of a congregation’s life. For example, a congregation that wanted to retain its tax exemption under section 501(c)(3) could not include political activity in its worship service unless the worship service was financed by a separate organization. Moreover, ADF believes that because IRS officials must examine the content of sermons or other religious messages to determine whether a church has improperly engaged in political advocacy, IRS enforcement of the rule entangles the government in the operation of religious organizations. If ADF’s protest leads to a constitutional challenge in court, what arguments might ADF make? The ADF would almost certainly argue that the 1954 amendment violates the First Amendment’s Free Exercise Clause, which prohibits the government from regulating religious organizations more strictly than their secular counterparts. Similarly, ADF will likely argue that the amendment violates the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, a 1993 federal statute that prohibits the federal government from imposing a “substantial burden” on a religious organization unless the government demonstrates that it must impose that burden to achieve a “compelling government interest.” The ADF will also likely argue that the restriction violates the First Amendment’s Free Speech Clause, which prohibits the government from regulating speech on the basis of its content. Finally, ADF might also claim that IRS enforcement of the 1954 amendment violates the First Amendment’s Establishment Clause by requiring the IRS to scrutinize sermons or other religious messages, thus excessively entangling government and religion. How might the government defend the 1954 amendment? The government will likely defend the 1954 amendment by arguing that the rule does not violate congregations’ rights under the Free Exercise Clause or RFRA because the restriction treats religious organizations just like other charitable and educational organizations. Moreover, the government would say, the restriction does not bar congregations from participating in campaigns; it only prohibits donors from making tax-deductible political contributions. Likewise, the government will likely argue, the restriction does not violate the Free Speech Clause because the restriction does not prohibit the congregations from making political statements; it only bars them from using tax-deductible donations to do so. Finally, in response to ADF’s Establishment Clause argument, the government will likely argue that there is no excessive entanglement of government and religion because the IRS does not need to evaluate a sermon’s theological merit to determine whether the sermon promotes a politician. How do you think a court might evaluate these arguments? It’s always difficult to predict how a court might decide a hypothetical case because a court’s decision often turns on a case’s particular facts. But past decisions give us a pretty good basis for guessing that a court would uphold the constitutionality of the 1954 amendment’s application to religious organizations. The most relevant case on this issue is Branch Ministries v. Rossotti (2000), a case in which the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit upheld the 1954 amendment’s constitutionality. That case arose after a congregation advocated for a presidential candidate, prompting the IRS to revoke the congregation’s 501(c)(3) status. The congregation claimed that this revocation violated the Free Exercise and Free Speech clauses. But the D.C. Circuit Court rejected both of these arguments on the ground that the congregation was still free to engage in political speech and activities. The D.C. Circuit Court’s reasoning in this case relied heavily on two U.S. Supreme Court decisions, Regan v. Taxation with Representation (1983) and Jimmy Swaggart Ministries v. Board of Equalization (1990). In Regan, the high court held that 501(c)(3) status provides a monetary benefit to certain tax-exempt organizations because it allows their donors to take a tax deduction for contributions. Therefore, the court concluded, the 1954 amendment does not violate the Free Speech Clause because the amendment merely withholds a speech subsidy rather than restricts speech. Similarly, in the Jimmy Swaggart Ministries case, the Supreme Court held that a tax imposed equally on all organizations does not violate the Free Exercise Clause. The court held that although the tax may increase the cost of religious activity, the tax does not impose a “substantial burden” on religious exercise because it does not prevent religious organizations from engaging in religious activity. If ADF challenged the 1954 amendment’s application to religious organizations, I think it is very likely that a court would agree with the Branch Ministries decision and reject the challenge. In the years since the Regan and Jimmy Swaggart Ministries cases, there have been a number of important changes in free exercise and free speech law, but those changes have only reinforced these decisions. If the 1954 amendment was lifted for religious organizations but not for other charitable organizations, would that raise a problem under the First Amendment’s Establishment Clause, which generally prohibits the government from favoring religion over nonreligion? This is an even more difficult and complicated question than the previous one, and I could see a court going either way. On the one hand, courts usually uphold legislative efforts to relieve burdens on religious activity, even if those burdens are not so “substantial” as to require an exemption under RFRA. So if Congress lifted the 1954 amendment, courts might be inclined to defer to the legislative judgment that the amendment should not apply to religious organizations. On the other hand, courts might be more skeptical of such a religion-specific exemption from the 1954 amendment because this exemption would potentially provide religious organizations with a very significant benefit not extended to other charitable organizations. Indeed, if the 1954 amendment applied to all 501(c)(3) organizations except religious ones, those who contribute to congregations engaged in political activity would be allowed to take an income tax deduction for their contributions – thus offsetting some of the actual cost of the donation – while contributors to other political organizations would not be allowed to deduct their contributions. In other words, the government would effectively subsidize the political activities of congregations. Such a subsidy raises serious questions under the Establishment Clause. In Texas Monthly v. Bullock (1989), the Supreme Court held that a Texas law that exempted religious publications but not other publications from sales taxes violated the Establishment Clause because the exemption effectively subsidized religious publications. The court explained that although the government may alleviate special burdens on religious activity, the sales tax did not present such a special burden because it applied equally to both religious and nonreligious publications. So the Texas Monthly decision strongly suggests that lifting the 1954 amendment only for religious organizations would violate the Establishment Clause. But that doesn’t mean that the present Supreme Court would definitely find a constitutional violation if Congress lifted the restriction only for religious organizations. Indeed, because the present court has a much narrower view of the Establishment Clause than the court that decided Texas Monthly, the present court might be willing to overrule the Texas Monthly decision. The ADF is no doubt hoping that this will be the case. As I said, it’s very difficult to guess how a court would decide this issue."

Much more needs to be done for Syrian refugees and for the global crisis that has seen more people flee persecution than at any time ever recorded.” At the end of 2015, war, conflict and persecution had forced 65.3 million people globally to flee for their lives, an all-time high. The Syrian refugee crisis is the world’s largest and more than 4.8 million have fled mostly to neighbouring countries whose resources are stretched thin so that increasing numbers of refugees live below national poverty lines. To aid the most vulnerable refugees and to share the tremendous burden of these refugee-hosting countries, UNHCR has called on governments to resettle those most at risk. So far resettlement countries have pledged a total of more than 220,000 places for Syrians under resettlement and other humanitarian admissions programmes. Around 478,000 Syrians are considered to be in need of resettlement – close to 40 per cent of the 1.19 million people who are in need of resettlement globally. UNHCR recognizes that opportunities for resettlement are extremely limited and so reserves this for persons who are most at risk, such as unaccompanied children, women-headed households, victims of torture, and persons with special medical needs. UNHCR identifies and carefully screens all refugees before they are referred to a country for resettlement. In the case of the United States, all refugees who are referred then undergo extensive face-to-face interviews with Department of Homeland Security officers, along with multiple layers of identity and security checks in a thorough process undertaken by US authorities. UNHCR calls for increased efforts to provide Syrian refugees with additional safe and regular pathways for admission. The United Nations General Assembly Summit for Refugees and Migrants on 19 September and the President of the United States Summit on Refugees on 20 September will provide opportunities for countries to show solidarity with refugee-hosting countries across the globe by giving Syrian and other vulnerable refugee groups legal opportunities to access safety and protection through resettlement and other pathways for admission. “Resettling refugees, along with continued humanitarian funding, is a critical form of solidarity with refugee-hosting countries and it needs to be expanded worldwide,” said Pitterman."
2,politifact11989,0,http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/memory-lapse-trump-seeks-distance-advisor-past-ties/story?id=34600826,Memory Lapse? Trump Seeks Distance From 'Advisor' With Past Ties to Mafia," -- Though he touts his outstanding memory, when Donald Trump was asked under oath about his dealings with a twice-convicted Russian émigré who served prison time and had documented mafia connections, the real estate mogul was at a loss. Even though the man, Felix Sater, had played a role in a number of high-profile Trump-branded projects across the country. “If he were sitting in the room right now, I really wouldn't know what he looked like,” Trump testified in a video deposition for a civil lawsuit two years ago. In recent weeks, the Republican Presidential candidate has been fending off critics who have accused him of embellishment, insensitivity and in some cases inaccuracy for his descriptions of the Muslim response to 9/11. Trump also dismissed outrage at his purported mocking of a disabled New York Times reporter, saying he simply does not remember meeting the scribe. Away from the spotlight, Donald Trump has also been seeking to minimize his past business ties with Sater, the Russian émigré who appeared in photos with Trump, and carried a Trump Organization business card with the title “Senior Advisor to Donald Trump.” Asked last week about Sater by The Associated Press, Trump again seemed unable to retrieve a solid memory of the man. ""Felix Sater, boy, I have to even think about it,"" he told the reporter. ""I'm not that familiar with him."" Trump and Sater can be seen together in photographs attending a Denver business conference in 2005, and the two men posed on stage together at the 2007 launch party for the Trump SoHo Hotel and Condominium project. And in 2010, according to Trump’s lawyer, Sater was provided business cards by the Trump Organization identifying him as a “senior advisor"" to Trump. Sater has declined repeated requests for an interview, citing the advice of his attorney. But he has not been shy about posting items online touting his ties to Trump. On his website, he called the Trump SoHo his “most prized project.” For years he identified himself on his online resume at the LinkedIn website as having been a ""senior advisor"" to Trump in 2010-2011. Last month, after ABC News asked Trump’s attorney about it, that portion of Sater’s online resume was deleted. The “senior advisor” title stands in sharp contrast to how Trump and his aides have repeatedly described the nature of their connection with Sater, including in response to questions from ABC News. Alan Garten, Trump’s General Counsel, initially told ABC News that Trump “had no real direct relationship with Felix Sater” and that Sater was not an advisor to Donald Trump “in my mind, and not in anyone at the Trump Organization's mind.” A few days later, Garten confirmed the authenticity of Sater’s Trump business card with the “senior advisor” title which included a Trump Organization email address and phone number. But the lawyer said the title was not reflective of Sater’s actual role. It was common practice in the real estate industry, he said, to provide business cards and bestow titles “in order for brokers to be able to make initial introductions.” Garten said Sater was “never employed by or on the payroll of the Trump organization” and that “no deals ever came from those activities” in 2010. But Garten declined to respond to emails and phone messages with further questions, including whether Sater was provided office space or compensated by the Trump organization in any other way. Images of Sater’s business card were wiped from the internet shortly after ABC News asked Garten about it. Trump’s extensive business relationships are garnering fresh attention as the public is becoming better acquainted with the real estate mogul-turned-politician who has catapulted into front-runner territory in the race for the GOP presidential nomination. The cast of characters who participated in Trump’s many development deals touch on a topic the candidate regularly cites on the campaign trail -- his judgment at the helm of his real estate empire. Trump says his “tremendous” record of success is one of his most important qualifications to become President of the United States. The connection to Felix Sater dates to the early 2000's when the Trump Organization worked on several occasions with a small development firm based in Trump Tower called the Bayrock Group, where Sater was an executive until 2007. As Trump explained it during a 2013 deposition, the relationship began when Bayrock was a tenant in his Trump Tower office building, when “somebody from Bayrock, I'm not exactly sure, came to see -- either myself or one of my children” with a proposal for a development deal. “It could have been Felix Sater, it could have been -- I really don't know who it might have been,” Trump said, “but somebody from Bayrock.” Sater had already served prison time for a grisly 1991 assault at the El Rio Grande restaurant and bar in New York. According to court documents, Sater allegedly told a man at the bar, “I’ll kill you. I’ll rip your f****** head off and stick it down your throat.” Sater then allegedly grabbed a frozen margarita from the bar, flung the contents in the air, smashed the glass on the bar, and stabbed the man in the cheek and neck, breaking his cheek and jaw, lacerating face and neck and severing nerves. He was convicted of first degree assault. As he began his work with Bayrock, Sater was also awaiting sentencing for his role in what authorities called a $40 million “pump and dump” stock scam. Federal prosecutors announced in a March 2, 2000 press release that Sater had pleaded guilty in the federal racketeering case, and was found to have been collaborating with members of four New York mob families. Sater and others had “planned and carried out a series of fraudulent securities schemes and then laundered tens of millions of dollars in illicit profits,” the release said. Prosecutors said Sater and others had “enlisted the help of individuals affiliated with organized crimes families of La Cosa Nostra to protect and promote their criminal activities.” Sater avoided prison after FBI agents testified at his sentencing hearing that he had become an important government witness on both mob-related and national security matters, heralded by federal agents for his cooperation. His lawyer, Robert Wolf, told the Associated Press that some of the information about Sater in public records and lawsuits is defamatory. Wolf told the AP that credits Sater's stint as a government cooperator with potentially saving American military lives, although he did not provide details. Wolf told the AP to write about Sater's past ""at your own risk"" but did not cite specific concerns. During this period, Sater’s role at Bayrock was not clearly defined. He at various times appeared in company emails and other records as the “chief operating officer” or “managing director.” In a 2010 deposition Sater said titles at the firm varied. “I was probably number two man in the company,” he said. “The actual position, I don't remember what it was.” While the Trump SoHo project was considered a success, four other Bayrock projects were either never built or were finished by others. Some of them resulted in lawsuits from unhappy investors. In each case, Trump was not the actual developer of the project and was, instead, paid a fee to license the use of his name and potentially operate the hotel projects. During this period, Trump and Bayrock also collaborated on a proposal for the 600,000-square-foot Trump International Hotel and Residences, Phoenix, that was to include a spa, swimming pools, “exquisite gardens,” and “a world-class celebrity chef restaurant.” The project never got off the ground, however, and in a 2007 lawsuit filed in state court against “the Trump/Bayrock Organization,” the plaintiff alleged that Sater threatened one of the Arizona partners in the deal, a man named Earnest Mennes. Sater was alleged to have told Mennes he would call in a relative to “electrically shock Mr. Mennes' testicles, cut off Mr. Mennes' legs, and leave Mr. Mennes dead in the trunk of his car.” Sater’s lawyer calls the allegation “an outright fabrication” made as part of a lawsuit demanding a financial settlement. Reached in Arizona, Mennes said the matter had been settled out of court and he could not discuss it. Mennes said he reflects proudly on the time he worked on the Trump project, and considers Trump a masterful businessman. Trump’s lawyer said he was unaware of the allegations in the Arizona lawsuit. Trump’s attorney says the real estate mogul had minimal interaction with Sater on the various joint ventures with Bayrock, and so had no reason to probe deeply into his background. “To be clear,” Garten told ABC News, “Mr. Sater's involvement in the projects, the projects that went forward, SoHo and Fort Lauderdale, may have existed in the beginning, but long term there was very little involvement.” Sater's alleged ties to organized crime were more widely publicized in December 2007 when The New York Times published an article featuring Sater’s ties to Trump and describing his “tangled past.” The article reported that Sater “had been an ‘unindicted co-conspirator’ and a key figure in a $40 million scheme involving 19 stockbrokers and organized crime figures from four Mafia families.” Sater told the Times that activity was in the past. “I’m trying to lead an exemplary existence,” he said then. “Old, bad luggage is not something anyone wants to remember.” While Sater’s criminal conviction had been publicized, much of his role in the racketeering case had until that point been kept secret -- sealed by the government because Sater had become a “cooperator” on a range of matters. Sater’s attorney provided ABC News with a copy of a public statement from Attorney General Loretta Lynch, whose New York office had enlisted cooperation from Sater when she was serving as a U.S. Attorney. “The defendant in question, Felix Sater, provided valuable and sensitive information to the government during the course of his cooperation,” her statement said. He provided information “crucial to national security and the conviction of over 20 individuals, including those responsible for committing massive financial fraud and members of La Cosa Nostra.” Garten said Trump read the 2007 Times report and was “surprised.” “He had no idea,” Garten said. It “was the first time that both the Trump organization and Bayrock learned of Mr. Sater's background.” Garten added, “When you go into business with another company, you're going to vet that company certainly, but you're not going to vet every employee, it’s just not appropriate."" Once that information became publicly known, Garten initially told ABC News, Trump “cut all ties” with Sater. But, Garten then acknowledged, the Trump organization continued to listen to deals pitched by Sater well after that. Asked why Trump would listen to a deal brought by a twice-convicted felon with alleged mafia ties, Garten told ABC News, “You’re going to look at the deal, you’re not going to look at the broker.” During his 2013 deposition, when asked about how much he knew about Sater’s past, Trump said he knew Sater had “got into trouble because he got into a barroom fight which a lot of people do.” And, he added, “I don’t know him very well, but I don’t think he was connected to the mafia.” In 2013, the BBC pressed Trump asking why he didn’t say “You’re fired!” to Sater after reports surfaced alleging Sater had ties to organized crime, Trump ultimately rose from his chair mid-interview. “I hate to do this, but I do have that big group of people waiting so I have to leave,” he said, walking out of the room. Trump said during the deposition four months later he could not recall doing the BBC interview. In August, the Washington Examiner asked Trump's campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, about the mogul’s past dealings with Sater. ""I have no idea who Felix Sater is, he has nothing to do with the Donald J. Trump for President presidential campaign,"" Lewandowski replied. ""I've never heard of the guy.” For investors who put money into those Trump-branded projects based on the reputation of the man behind the name brand, news that one of the people involved, Sater, had such a checkered criminal history was distressing. Cathy Cather, a Fort Lauderdale healthcare consultant, invested and lost money in the Trump condominium hotel project in her hometown – which failed in part because of the economic collapse. She told ABC News she made her decision in part based on glossy brochures emblazoned with Trump’s photos and such slogans as ""There is luxury... And then there is THE TRUMP EXPERIENCE."" “I invested because it was Trump,” Cather told ABC News. ABC News' Randy Kreider and Alex Hosenball contributed to this report."

According to recent studies, and an editorial in the New York Times, there is increasing evidence that black and Hispanic borrowers were more likely to be steered to high-cost subprime loans than other borrowers. Hundreds of thousands of African American families – many of whom probably should have been eligible for lower cost prime loans instead of riskier subprime loans – could potentially lose their homes in the coming years. In the letter, Obama requests that the FTC investigate whether there is evidence that lenders or brokers target poor or minority borrowers with higher cost products, whether lenders are engaging in deceptive marketing practices, and whether the lack of lower-cost borrowing options has disproportionately disadvantaged minority borrowers. The text of the letter is below: October 18, 2007  The Honorable Deborah Platt Majoras Federal Trade Commission 600 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20580  Dear Commissioner Majoras: I am writing to bring to your attention the attached editorial from yesterday's New York Times which begins: ""Evidence is mounting that during the housing boom, black and Hispanic borrowers were far more likely to be steered into high-cost subprime loans than other borrowers, even after controlling for factors such as income, loan size and property location."" (""Subprime in Black and White,"" The New York Times, October 17, 2007) In reality, such evidence has been mounting since the 1990s when the Clinton Administration found that subprime loans in 1998 were over four times more prevalent in predominantly black neighborhoods in New York than in predominantly white neighborhoods. More recent studies have found similar examples of potentially discriminatory lending patterns. Last year, for example, the Center for Responsible Lending found that for most types of subprime home loans, minority borrowers are more likely to pay higher rates than white borrowers even after accounting for differences in credit scores, loan to value ratios, and other underwriting criteria. And just this week another analysis confirmed that even high-income black borrowers are more likely than comparable white borrowers to have risky and costly subprime loans. Black families are paying more for home loans than similarly situated white families. Effective action to address this disparity is long overdue. I call upon the FTC to investigate the marketing practices of subprime lenders and the brokers of subprime loans to determine if minority borrowers have been the victims of discrimination. Among other things, the Federal Trade Commission is charged with protecting consumers from unfair or deceptive marketing acts or practices. Many subprime loans include sales practices or loan features that are potentially unfair and deceptive for borrowers. Some practices, such as yield-spread premiums, which encourage mortgage brokers to steer borrowers into the most costly products, or prepayment penalties, which enable lenders to offer mortgages that are unsupported by sound underwriting principles, appear to be the source of significant problems faced by many subprime borrowers. With an estimated 53% of African American borrowers in 2005 receiving subprime loans, and more than 60% of subprime loans containing prepayment penalties, the risks particularly for African American homeowners are substantial. Indeed, hundreds of thousands of African American families – many of whom probably should have been eligible for lower cost prime loans instead of riskier subprime loans – are expected to face loss of their homes in the coming years. I request that you begin a thorough investigation within five days and provide a status report to my office within 15 days on the following questions: 1) Whether there is evidence of lenders or brokers specifically targeting poor or minority borrowers with higher cost products than would otherwise be justified based on legitimate underwriting criteria. 2) Whether the marketing of lending products to poor or minority borrowers has been deceptive or unfair. Specifically, whether the disclosure of yield-spread premiums and prepayment penalties has been sufficiently transparent to borrowers and whether such or similar sales and pricing practices have been disproportionately detrimental to minority borrowers.  3) Whether the lack of lower-cost borrowing options, including those regulated by the Federal government, in predominantly minority communities even for higher-income borrowers, has disproportionately disadvantaged minority borrowers in their efforts to realize the dream of affordable home ownership and wealth building.  Thank you for your assistance protecting all consumers from the pernicious affects of predatory and discriminatory lending practices which undermine the American dream.  Sincerely,  Barack Obama United States Senator"

Bernie Sanders earned laughter and applause during Saturday's Democratic debate for a line defending his progressive tax policy. When asked how he would pay for proposals like tuition-free college for Americans, Sanders said he would finance them by ""due-demanding: that the wealthiest people and the largest corporations - have gotten away with murder for years - start paying their fair share."" CBS News Congressional Correspondent Nancy Cordes pressed the White House hopeful: ""Let's get specific. How high would you go? You've said before you'd go above 50 percent. How high?"" ""We haven't come up with an exact number yet,"" Sanders responded. ""But it will not be as high as the number under Dwight D. Eisenhower which was 90 percent."" As an aside, he said, to loud cheers in the audience: ""I'm not that much of a socialist compared to Eisenhower."" Sanders went on to say that his administration would ""end the absurdities as Warren Buffet often reminds us - that billionaires pay an effective tax rate lower than nurses, or truck drivers that makes no sense at all. There has to be real tax reform and the wealthiest and the large corporations will pay when I'm president."" In fact, during the first term of Republican President Eisenhower, the marginal tax rate on regular income for those earning over $400,000 -- at the time, the highest income bracket -- was 92 percent. The tax rate was carried over from Democratic President Harry Truman's administration. This was the second-highest tax rate during the 20th century, following the 94 percent instituted by President Roosevelt during World War II for those making over $200,000 annually. In 1954, under Eisenhower, the rate for the highest income bracket decreased to 91 percent. Taking into account these income tax rates, Sanders' assertion that he's not as ""socialist"" as Eisenhower's administration is correct: Sanders has said before that he doesn't believe his tax policy would tax the top bracket over 90 percent, though he has yet to offer up an exact number. Appearing on ""CBS This Morning"" in September, Sanders said ""We are going to ask the wealthiest people in this country who are doing phenomenally well, and many large corporations that are making billions of dollars of profits and not paying a nickel in taxes, to in fact start paying their fair share of taxes."" When asked to specify, the Vermont senator said of taxing those in the highest income bracket, ""I don't think you have to go up to 90 percent."" Sanders, however, has also called for greater increases in capital gains taxes, which were capped at 25 percent during most of Eisenhower's tenure. During Saturday's debate, former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley also defended asking the wealthy to pay a higher share of taxes. ""Under Ronald Reagan's first term, the highest marginal rate was 70 percent,"" he pointed out. O'Malley is also correct on this point: Under President Reagan, those with annual incomes over $215,400 were taxed at a rate of 69.1 percent."
5,politifact4306,0,http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/15/opinion/stop-coddling-the-super-rich.html,Stop Coddling the Super-Rich - The New York Times,"Since 1992, the I.R.S. has compiled data from the returns of the 400 Americans reporting the largest income. In 1992, the top 400 had aggregate taxable income of $16.9 billion and paid federal taxes of 29.2 percent on that sum. In 2008, the aggregate income of the highest 400 had soared to $90.9 billion — a staggering $227.4 million on average — but the rate paid had fallen to 21.5 percent. The taxes I refer to here include only federal income tax, but you can be sure that any payroll tax for the 400 was inconsequential compared to income. In fact, 88 of the 400 in 2008 reported no wages at all, though every one of them reported capital gains. Some of my brethren may shun work but they all like to invest. (I can relate to that.) I know well many of the mega-rich and, by and large, they are very decent people. They love America and appreciate the opportunity this country has given them. Many have joined the Giving Pledge, promising to give most of their wealth to philanthropy. Most wouldn’t mind being told to pay more in taxes as well, particularly when so many of their fellow citizens are truly suffering. Twelve members of Congress will soon take on the crucial job of rearranging our country’s finances. They’ve been instructed to devise a plan that reduces the 10-year deficit by at least $1.5 trillion. It’s vital, however, that they achieve far more than that. Americans are rapidly losing faith in the ability of Congress to deal with our country’s fiscal problems. Only action that is immediate, real and very substantial will prevent that doubt from morphing into hopelessness. That feeling can create its own reality. Job one for the 12 is to pare down some future promises that even a rich America can’t fulfill. Big money must be saved here. The 12 should then turn to the issue of revenues. I would leave rates for 99.7 percent of taxpayers unchanged and continue the current 2-percentage-point reduction in the employee contribution to the payroll tax. This cut helps the poor and the middle class, who need every break they can get. But for those making more than $1 million — there were 236,883 such households in 2009 — I would raise rates immediately on taxable income in excess of $1 million, including, of course, dividends and capital gains. And for those who make $10 million or more — there were 8,274 in 2009 — I would suggest an additional increase in rate. My friends and I have been coddled long enough by a billionaire-friendly Congress. It’s time for our government to get serious about shared sacrifice."

The Affordable Care Act encourages state regulators to review premium rates proposed by health insurance companies, but allows the federal government to engage in such reviews if a state is found to have inadequate protection for consumers. While the federal government determined in early May that Florida’s Office of Insurance Regulation was legally capable of protecting consumers, on May 31, 2013 Governor Scott signed SB 1842 and explicitly forbid Insurance Commissioner Kevin McCarty from reviewing health insurance plans offered in the Marketplace for at least two years.  In the letter, the Representatives write that the premium increases are “not a coincidence, but rather the product of a cynical and intentional effort by Governor Scott and the Florida legislature to undermine the Affordable Care Act and make health insurance premiums on the Florida Health Insurance Marketplace more expensive by refusing to allow the Insurance Commissioner either to negotiate lower rates with companies or refuse rates that are too high…. It is our hope that HHS will intervene on behalf of Florida consumers to ensure policies available on the Marketplace are fair and affordable. We believe HHS has the full authority under current law and federal regulations to undertake these actions. With two months remaining until the Marketplace is scheduled to open, we look forward to hearing from you regarding the actions the Department of Health and Human Services and CMS will take to protect Florida consumers – since Governor Scott, the Florida legislature, and Insurance Commissioner McCarty will not.”  Joining Rep. Deutch on the letter were Reps. Alcee L. Hastings, Corrine Brown, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Kathy Castor, Frederica S. Wilson, Joe Garcia, Alan Grayson, Lois Frankel, and Patrick E. Murphy. A text copy of the letter is available below.  August 1, 2013  The Honorable Kathleen Sebelius Secretary U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 200 Independence Ave., SW Washington, DC 20201  RE: Florida Health Insurance Marketplace Premium Rates  Dear Secretary Sebelius,  It has become abundantly clear that a law enacted by Florida Governor Rick Scott and the state legislature could leave consumers vulnerable to unreasonably high premiums on the Florida Health Insurance Marketplace. Therefore, we write you to ask for your assurance that the Department of Health and Human Services will exercise its authority to protect consumers in our State.  As you well know, the Affordable Care Act encourages state regulators to protect consumers from unreasonably high insurance premiums, in a process known as Rate Review. The law ensures that if states do not have an adequate Rate Review system in place, the federal government may step in to protect consumers from unjustifiable premiums. The time to step in is now.  As of May 3, 2013, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) determined that Florida’s Office of Insurance Regulation operated an Effective Rate Review Program. Led by a state Insurance Commissioner, this office has long been charged by Florida law to review proposed insurance rates.  Unfortunately, it appears that Florida Governor Rick Scott and the state legislature waited until CMS finalized this determination before passing a law to strip the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation of its authority to review insurance premiums and protect consumers. Signed into law on May 31st, 2013, Senate Bill 1842 forbids Florida’s Insurance Commissioner from reviewing health insurance plans offered on the new Marketplace on behalf of Florida consumers for at least two years. In our view, the passage of this law invalidates CMS’s determination that Florida had an effective Rate Review Program and thus necessitates that the federal government take up an expanded role in Florida to protect consumers.  Indeed in other states, like Maryland that released its rates last week, where state insurance commissioners have Rate Review and full negotiating power, health insurance premiums are substantially lower.  Over 3.9 million people in Florida are uninsured, and the availability of affordable coverage on Florida’s new Marketplace will be vital to expanding coverage. This week, Florida Insurance Commissioner Kevin McCarty indicated that premiums for the plans that will be offered this October will increase between 30 and 40 percent in the individual market, and 5 to 20 percent in the small-group market. This is not a coincidence, but rather the product of a cynical and intentional effort by Governor Scott and the Florida legislature to undermine the Affordable Care Act and make health insurance premiums on the Florida Health Insurance Marketplace more expensive by refusing to allow the Insurance Commissioner either to negotiate lower rates with companies or refuse rates that are too high. Florida legislators also directed the Office of Insurance Regulation to ignore the significant tax credits for Floridians that will make health insurance even more affordable.  While other states have reported great success in driving down premium rates proposed by insurance companies seeking to sell policies on their Marketplaces, officials in Florida have proactively abdicated any responsibility to protect consumers. The actions taken by Governor Scott and the legislature have made consumers vulnerable to the will of insurance companies, and it is time for the federal government to step in.  The Affordable Care Act provides important consumer protections and protects Americans from unreasonable health insurance premiums. It is our hope that HHS will intervene on behalf of Florida consumers to ensure policies available on the Marketplace are fair and affordable. We believe HHS has the full authority under current law and federal regulations to undertake these actions. With two months remaining until the Marketplace is scheduled to open, we look forward to hearing from you regarding the actions the Department of Health and Human Services and CMS will take to protect Florida consumers – since Governor Scott, the Florida legislature, and Insurance Commissioner McCarty will not.  Thank you in advance for your prompt attention to this matter."
7,politifact13619,0,http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/05/politics/border-wall-house-republicans-donald-trump-taxpayers/,"Trump asking Congress, not Mexico, to pay for border wall","Washington (CNN) President-elect Donald Trump's transition team has signaled to congressional Republican leaders that his preference is to fund the border wall through the appropriations process as soon as April, according to House Republican officials. The move would break a key campaign promise when Trump repeatedly said he would force Mexico to pay for the construction of the wall along the border, though in October, Trump suggested for the first time that Mexico would reimburse the US for the cost of the wall. Trump defended that proposal Friday morning in a tweet, saying the move to use congressional appropriations was because of speed. ""The dishonest media does not report that any money spent on building the Great Wall (for sake of speed), will be paid back by Mexico later!"" Trump tweeted Friday. The dishonest media does not report that any money spent on building the Great Wall (for sake of speed), will be paid back by Mexico later! New York Rep. Chris Collins said Friday that American taxpayers would front the cost for the wall but that he was confident Trump could negotiate getting the money back from Mexico. ""When you understand that Mexico's economy is dependent upon US consumers, Donald Trump has all the cards he needs to play,"" Collins, congressional liaison for the Trump transition team, told CNN's Alisyn Camerota on ""New Day."" ""On the trade negotiation side, I don't think it's that difficult for Donald Trump to convince Mexico that it's in their best interest to reimburse us for building the wall."" The Trump team argues it will have the authority through a Bush-era 2006 law to build the wall, lawmakers say, but it lacks the money to do so. Transition officials have told House GOP leaders in private meetings they'd like to pay for the wall in the funding bill, a senior House GOP source said. ""It was not done in the Obama administration, so by funding the authorization that's already happened a decade ago, we could start the process of meeting Mr. Trump's campaign pledge to secure the border,"" Indiana Republican Rep. Luke Messer said on Thursday. Messer admitted it's ""big dollars, but it's a question of priorities."" He pointed to a border security bill that Homeland Security Chairman Mike McCaul proposed last year that cost roughly $10 billion. ""Democrats may well find themselves in the position to shut down all of government to stop the buildout of a wall, or of a barrier, or of a fence,"" Messer said. Mexican leaders have repeatedly said they will not pay for the wall. If Mexico refuses to pay for the wall, the GOP could add billions of dollars into the spending bill that needs to pass by April 28 to keep the government open. But doing so would force a showdown with Senate Democrats and potentially threaten a government shutdown. No decisions have been made, GOP sources said. Republicans point out that then-Sen. Barack Obama, Sen. Chuck Schumer and then-Sen. Hillary Clinton voted for the 2006 bill and argued that since Democrats backed that bill, they should support efforts to fund the current effort. The thinking behind the strategy is that it is harder for Democrats to filibuster spending bills because of the high stakes involved if they fail to pass in time. Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the No. 3 Republican in the House leadership, declined to say Thursday if Congress would pay for the wall. ""We want President Trump to have all the tools he needs to build the wall,"" Scalise said. ""We're in talks with him on the details of it as they're still putting together their team. We still got a few months before there's another funding bill that's going to move. We're going to work with him to make sure we can get it done. We want to build a wall. He wants to build a wall."" Could Mexico pay for the border wall? Trump himself has estimated his border wall would cost $8 billion, though other analysts have estimated the price would be as much as $10 billion . And the proposals Trump has outlined to coerce Mexico into paying for the wall involve controversial measures that would still likely fail to cover the wall's full cost. According to Trump's website , those steps could include: remittance seizure, potential tariffs and foreign aids cuts, increasing fees on temporary visas issued to Mexican CEOs and diplomats, increasing fees on border crossing cards, increasing fees on NAFTA worker visas; and increasing fees at ports of entry to the US from Mexico. A major challenge for judging Trump's proposal is that most of those steps amount to a drop in the bucket -- less than $1 billion -- compared to the proposed cost of the wall. And the one step that could provide the required amount of money -- remittance seizure -- would face major legal obstacles, in addition to the likelihood of severe domestic and international backlash. Total US foreign aid to Mexico is less than $200 million a year ( $186,000,000 in the 2014 fiscal year ), so redirecting all of that money to a border wall would only put a mild dent in the $8 billion bill. And it's difficult to know the amount of revenue generated from a tariff on Mexican exports -- or to account for potential losses from a retaliatory tariff -- without the specifics of the tax. Moving next to fee increases, Trump says on his website that ""even a small increase in visa fees would pay for the wall. This includes fees on border crossing cards, of which more than 1 million are issued a year."" But the fees for visas and border crossing cards range from around $150 to $200 each, according to State Department data. Accounting for all the fees on over a million border crossing cards and visas in a year year -- and even accounting for a twofold increase in those fees -- that would still only generate about half a billion dollars, well short of an $8 billion price tag. The biggest potential source of money for the wall would come from remittance seizure: remittance payments are money that immigrants, legal and illegal, earn in their country of residence and send back to their families in their native country. Trump says on his website that he would use the Patriot Act to require legal identification for money transfer transactions, according to his website. But CNN legal analyst Paul Callan says Trump's plan would likely face multiple legal battles. ""The Mexican immigrants Trump seeks to target are clearly not the 'Radical Islamic Terrorists' that the Patriot Act was designed to fight,"" says Callan. ""The courts are likely to view Mr. Trump's use of the always controversial Patriot Act as an improper and illegal use. The proposal may also fail to place pressure on the Mexican government as money can be smuggled back to Mexico in many other creative ways if wire transfers are cut."" The size of Mexico's remittance revenue far surpasses any other revenue-raising proposal from Trump, and would probably be the most effective way to pay for the border wall. But looking at the obstacles that such an action would face, it's difficult to envision a path to impounding those payments to pay for the wall."

Russian President Vladimir Putin PAVEL GOLOVKIN / Pool via AFP - Getty Images State-run pollster VTsIOM said a record 89.9 percent of Russians approved of Putin in its latest weekly survey — up from 86.6 percent a week earlier and above the previous record of 89.1 in June 2015. ""Such high approval rating of the president of Russia had to do mostly with the events in Syria, [and] Russian airstrikes on terrorist positions,"" VTsIOM said on its website. Moscow claims the air operation in Syria is aimed at weakening ISIS. Western officials have questioned whether Russia is actually targeting moderate rebels in a move to bolster its flagging ally, Syrian President Bashar Assad. Related: Assad Goes to Moscow to Say Thanks to Putin Putin’s rating had been hovering above 80 percent since spring 2014, when Russia annexed Ukraine’s Crimea peninsula and endorsed a bloody pro-Russian uprising in eastern Ukraine. With the latest VTsIOM poll, Putin's popularity is now just a notch below that of Central Asian dictators — who can often rack up between 90 and 97 percent of votes in elections. While VTsIOM is a respected pollster, analysts have long questioned Russian approval polls. Studies show that in authoritarian states, polls can overstate the popularity of incumbent leaders by between 5 and 20 percent because many respondents give the answers that they think are expected of them. Related: Syrians Say Russian Airstrikes Bring 'Massive Destruction' The latest figures come amid a prolonged economic slump.

Once considered the party of online innovation, new research and a host of media reports show that Democrats are largely ignoring some of the most popular social media communities on the web. Recent data shows that nearly 50 percent of adults are active on social networks, nearly two-thirds watch online videos on sites such as YouTube, while over seven million people have joined the fastest-growing online member community, Twitter. Apparently no one has faxed that data to congressional Democrats, however, as the vast majority has yet to incorporate many of these popular technologies into their day-to-day communications. Meanwhile, House Republicans, seeing a unique opportunity to communicate directly with the American people without the traditional media filters of the past, are busy forging new connections with their constituents online. A recently-released report, Twongress: The Power of Twitter in Congress shows us the most glaring example of this party disparity:  “More Republicans Use Twitter Than Democrats - In Congress, there are 132 members who are using Twitter actively: 89 Republicans and 43 Democrats..in the House, there are 75 Republicans using Twitter (42.13 percent of the Republican Caucus) and 32 Democrats (12.45 percent of the Democratic Caucus).""

Thanks for your friendship. Thanks for your leadership. The Congress will miss you when you leave its ranks, but I have a feeling that you are going to be spending a lot of time right here in Harlem. Charlie didn’t tell you the whole story. He was actually the person who called to encourage me to run for the Senate. He basically said that I had no choice. But it took me a long time before I realized he was right. He’s been a great friend and partner since then. I want to tell you how special it is for me to be back here in Harlem to make this set of comments. I loved representing New York for eight years. And Harlem looms large in the American imagination, as the birthplace of so much art and culture and such vibrant public life. There’s really no place like it in the world. I appreciate being joined by the Governor [Cuomo] and Sandra, by the Mayor [De Blasio] and Chirlane, by the former Attorney General, Eric Holder, Representative Yvette Clark, and Representative Nydia Velázquez, our Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito, Public Advocate Letitia James. I want to thank Dr. Khalil Gibran Muhammad, and to all of the New York State Black, Puerto Rican, Hispanic and Asian caucus members and members of the New York City Council. The Black, Latino, and Asian Caucus: I thank you all so much for being here. I want to pick up on what I just said about Harlem, because Harlem, and many other communities across America, remind us that any view of Black America that focuses exclusively on crime, poverty, or other challenges is missing so much. Missing the strength and the pride and the achievement that is evident on every street here. That narrative is missing the remarkable rise of the African American middle class, the rise of African American … leadership in all walks of life: in business, law, politics, science, the arts, sports, and all the professions. It’s missing the vibrancy of the black church, the passionate advocacy of the next generation of changemakers, and the service of leaders at every level, who never tire of making others’ lives better. Earlier today, I spent some time with the heads of nine of America’s historic civil rights groups, hosted by Marc Morial of the National Urban League. Reverend Al Sharpton attended. And we had a great conversation, because they are working to drive a 21st century agenda for jobs and freedom. I am grateful for their guidance and wisdom. I am also grateful to be speaking in this building that honors two men who represent just some of the diversity of the African American community. Arturo Schomburg, who was from the Caribbean, and Langston Hughes, whose ashes are housed here, reminded all of us that when life ain’t no crystal stair, you’ve got to keep climbing. That’s a good lesson for everyone. But even as we acknowledge and even celebrate successes, it’s important to remember: There are still very real barriers holding back African Americans from fully participating in our society. That’s what I am here to talk about today. Last week on the debate stage in Milwaukee, I said I want to tear down all the barriers that hold back Americans across racial lines, because our country can only live up to its potential when every single American has the chance to live up to theirs. So I want to talk with you about how we break down the barriers that disproportionately affect African Americans and build ladders of opportunity in their place. Last week, I went to Flint, Michigan. By now, we all know what’s happening there. Families, children, babies, drinking poisoned water for nearly two years because their government wanted to save a little money. It’s a horrifying story, but what makes it even worse is that it’s not a coincidence that this was allowed to happen in a largely black, largely poor community. Just ask yourself, would this have ever occurred in a wealthy white suburb of Detroit? Absolutely not. And as we have learned more about this crisis, we’ve seen other barriers holding back the people of Flint coming into clearer focus. Years of under-investment have left behind a hollowed out community without enough jobs or opportunity for the people living there. Not enough families have access to the quality education that their children deserve. And they have too little political power, which left them vulnerable to a state government that ignored and dismissed their concerns. Just imagine — every one of you a parent, a grandparent, an aunt, an uncle — going to the authorities holding a bottle of brown, smelly water. Telling those in authority, “There’s something wrong with this water. My baby has a rash. I feel funny when I drink it or take a bath,” and being told, “There’s nothing wrong with the water. Just go away.” Flint is not alone. There are many Flints across our country: places where people of color and the poor have been left out and left behind. Now, in the contest for the Democratic nomination, we have spent a lot of time debating about the big banks and the excesses of Wall Street, and these are important issues. And I am absolutely committed to ensuring that no bank is too big to fail, and no executive too powerful to jail. But Flint reminds us there’s a lot more going on in our country that we should be concerned about. The truth is we aren’t a single-issue country. We face a complex set of economic, social, and political challenges. They are intersectional, they are reinforcing, and we have got to take them all on. So it’s not enough for your economic plan to be, “break up the banks.” You also need a serious plan to create jobs, especially in places where unemployment remains stubbornly high. You need a plan to address the generations of underinvestment and neglect. Now even if we succeed on raising taxes on every millionaire and billionaire in America — and believe me, I do intend to succeed at that — we still need to face the painful reality that African Americans are nearly three times as likely as whites to be denied a mortgage. Something’s wrong when the median wealth for black families is just a tiny fraction of the median wealth of white families. And when gun violence is by far the leading cause of death for young African American men, outstripping the next nine causes of death combined, there is something deeply wrong. Something is wrong when African American men are far more likely to be stopped and searched by police, charged with crimes, and sentenced to longer prison terms than white men convicted of the same offenses. And when black kids get arrested for petty crimes, but white CEO’s get away with fleecing our entire country, there is something wrong. Just imagine with me, for a minute, if white kids were 500 percent more likely to die from asthma than black kids. Five hundred percent. Imagine if a white baby in South Carolina were twice as likely to die before her first birthday than an African American baby. Imagine the outcry. Imagine the resources that would flood in. Now, these inequities are wrong — but they’re also immoral. And it’ll be the mission of my presidency to bring them to an end. We have to begin by facing up to the reality of systemic racism. Because these are not only problems of economic inequality. These are problems of racial inequality. And we have got to say that loudly and clearly. Now, I don’t by any means intend to imply that we are not still making progress. We do have a lot to celebrate, as Congressman Rangel said. The people in this room know that — you have helped to make it happen. And there is no better example of that progression than our president. And for all the partisan resistance President Obama has faced every day, remember — and celebrate — he brought our economy back from the brink of another Great Depression. On his watch, 14 million jobs have been created, health care has been brought to 18 million people, the auto industry was saved, and so much else. Now, he would be the first to say — as we’ve heard him say — that despite our best efforts and our highest hopes, America’s long struggle with race is far from finished. For many white Americans, it’s tempting to believe that bigotry is largely behind us. That would leave us with a lot less work, wouldn’t it? But more than half a century after Rosa Parks sat and Dr. King marched and John Lewis bled, race still plays a significant role in determining who gets ahead in America and who gets left behind. Now anyone — anyone — asking for your vote has a responsibility to grapple with this reality. To see things as they actually are, not just as we want them to be. I’d be the first to admit I don’t have all the answers. I’ve made my own mistakes. I’ve walked my own journey. But I believe with all my heart we can and must do better. We’ve made progress before, which gives me hope we can do it again. In the 1990s, economic programs like the new market tax credit, the earned income tax credit, and empowerment zones like the one right here in Harlem made a real difference in people’s lives. They helped to create the highest increase in black incomes and the lowest black unemployment in history. We achieved record small-business lending to minority-owned businesses, and record bank lending in minority communities. Right here in Harlem, the unemployment rate dropped by two-thirds, and we saw a drop in child poverty and an increase in employment and income for single mothers, too. We also learned about what doesn’t work. Some of what we tried didn’t resolve problems. Some ended up creating new ones, and caused disappointment, frustration, even anger. So as we face today’s challenges, we have to bring all those lessons to bear. Here’s the bottom line, as I see it: When we make direct strategic investments in communities that have been left behind, and when we guarantee justice and dignity to every American, then we really can make progress. Lasting progress. Progress that will catapult us into the future. We can reduce poverty. We can build ladders of opportunity. So I’m proposing a comprehensive new commitment to equity and opportunity for African American communities. That means a real plan to create jobs. If I’m elected president, we will direct hundreds of billions of dollars in new investments to places like Harlem and rural South Carolina — including $20 billion aimed specifically at creating jobs for young people. The unemployment rate among young African Americans is twice as high as for young white people. Now, we need to get young people working, developing their skills, unlocking the full extent of the contributions they can make to themselves, their families, and our country. We need to make sure we’re not only creating good jobs, but connecting black communities to where the good jobs are. So we’ve got to be strategic about our investments in transit and infrastructure. And we need a real plan, including expanding access to capital to support black entrepreneurs — especially black women, who represent the fastest-growing segment of women-owned businesses in America. And while we’re at it, let’s finally ensure equal pay for equal work for women. That would benefit women of color most of all, and would lift up an awful lot of families. And let’s go even further. Let’s follow Governor Cuomo’s lead and raise the minimum wage to help people get out of poverty. Now we need to support African American homeownership, which has always been one of the surest ways for black families to build wealth. That’s why I have a plan that would, among things, help African American families save for a down payment. We need to make sure every family also has access to quality pre-school. And I applaud Mayor De Blasio for what he’s achieved here in New York with his pre-K program. And please, help us reverse the dangerous slide towards re-segregation in our schools. Our schools are now more segregated than they were in 1968. That is appalling, and we’ve got to fix it. We also have to make sure everyone who wants to go to college can afford to. And everyone with student debt can have that debt refinanced, and take thousands of dollars off the burden that they are carrying! Let’s give tax credits to businesses that actually invest in training and in apprenticeship programs to help young people who don’t go for a two or four-year degree. And my plan gives special support to historically black colleges and universities. The HBCUs have produced some of the finest leaders in our country. And it’s not just who they graduated in the past, it’s the work they’re still doing today — often against great odds. And then finally, and so importantly, we need end-to-end reform in our criminal justice system. Not half measures, but a full commitment with real follow-through. Now, this is something we can talk about for hours. In fact, I gave my first speech of this campaign in April not far from here, and it was about reforming criminal justice. Because the inequities that persist in our justice system undermine our shared vision of what America can — and should — be. Our legal system is still, all too often, stacked against those who have the least power, who are the most vulnerable. And we’ve seen the toll it takes on families torn apart by excessive incarceration, and children growing up in homes shattered by prison and poverty. We’ve got to get back to that fundamental principle that everyone, in every community, benefits when there is respect for the law — and when everyone is respected by the law. That is the formula for building trust and cooperation, and we need to not only acknowledge but fix the crisis of mass incarceration. Let’s finally, once and for all, eliminate the remaining disparity in sentencing between crack and powder cocaine. Let’s rebuild the bonds of trust between law enforcement and communities by creating more opportunities for people to actually interact with one another, to build relationships. Let’s the end the epidemic of African Americans being killed by police or dying in custody. Now I think you know — because I sure believe — there are many police officers out there every day inspiring trust and confidence, putting themselves on the line to save lives. So let’s learn from those who are doing it right, and apply those lessons across the country. Let’s make sure the Justice Department has the resources to hold departments — like Ferguson’s — accountable when they do it wrong. Again and again, something terrible happens — and no one is held accountable; the deeply troubling pattern, and we’ve got to break it. We’ve also got to do a much better job of helping people who have paid their debt to society find jobs and support when they get out. Up to 60 percent of prisoners who re-enter society face long-term unemployment. That’s a recipe for hopelessness and repeat offending. My jobs plan would make significant investments in re-entry programs for the formerly incarcerated. In my faith, we believe in second chances. In America, we believe in second chances. Let’s give those chances to people who need our help the most. Let’s give them a fair shot — which is also why I will “ban the box” in the federal government. And I want to thank Attorney General Holder, who has been really in the forefront of making so many of these changes happen. And I also want to thank another great New Yorker, Attorney General Loretta Lynch, who is continuing the work for equity and justice! And let’s roll up our sleeves and get to work to dismantle the school-to-prison pipeline. It’s diverting too many African-American kids into the criminal justice system, instead of giving them the education they deserve. We’ve seen a significant increase in police involvement in school discipline, especially in schools with majority-black students. We’re seeing an over-reliance on suspensions and expulsions. I’m sure many of us remember that horrifying video of the girl in South Carolina being thrown out of her desk and dragged across her classroom by a school police officer. A classroom should be a safe place for our children. We shouldn’t even have to say that, I don’t think. So today I’m announcing my plan to end the school to prison pipeline. It includes major investments in school districts that reform their discipline practices. We want districts to know, if they do the right thing, we’ll have their backs. And we will dramatically expand support for guidance counselors, school psychologists and social workers — so instead of just labeling kids problem students, they can actually help kids with their problems, and keep them in school! And for schools that refuse to reform and states that refuse to take this issue seriously, I want the Department of Education’s Office of Civil Rights to intervene, because this — this is not just an education issue, this is a civil rights issue and we cannot ignore it any longer. The bottom line is this: We need to be sending our kids to college. We need a cradle-to-college pipeline, not sending them into court and into prison. There’s much more to do. If you go to my website, hillaryclinton.com, you can read our full agenda. Sometimes people make fun of me because I actually tell you what I want to do as president. I actually give you plans about what I want to do. I kind of think it’s my duty to help inform voters, so that you can make a good decision! But I want to mention one more critical area: Protecting that most fundamental of rights — the right to vote. Across our country, Republican governors and legislatures are erecting one barrier after another that make it harder for black people to vote. It’s a blast from the Jim Crow past, and we need to call it for what it is. And in the past few days the stakes got even higher. Justice Scalia’s passing means the court hangs in the balance. Now the Republicans say they’ll reject anyone President Obama nominates, no matter how qualified. Some are even saying he doesn’t have the right to nominate anyone, as if somehow he’s not the real president. That’s in keeping with what we’ve heard all along, isn’t it? Many Republicans talk in coded, racial language about takers and losers. They demonize President Obama and encourage the ugliest impulses of the paranoid fringe. This kind of hatred and bigotry has no place in our politics — or our country. The president has the right to nominate, under the Constitution, and the Senate has the obligation to process that nomination. And I hope the Senate will start paying more attention to statesmanship than partisanship. And I hope that they will understand that we can have our differences, but let’s not go right after fundamental rules of how we govern ourselves. That’s a bridge way too far, my friends. Now, I will appoint Supreme Court justices who will see the Constitution as a blueprint for progress, not as an excuse to try to roll back decisions going all the way back to Teddy Roosevelt — which is apparently what some of them would prefer to do! Now I suppose some people will hear what I’m proposing and think, “Well, she’s saying this because she’s in an election.” But many of you in this audience know me, and you know that these issues have always been part of my North Star. In my first semester at law school, a woman named Marian Wright Edelman came to speak on campus at Yale. She was the first African American woman admitted to the Mississippi bar, a lawyer for the NAACP in Jackson, a friend of Dr. King before he was murdered — altogether a remarkable person. She talked about starting a Head Start program in Mississippi and using her legal education on behalf of poor children who were invisible to the rest of the country. Something clicked in my brain that day. Until I heard Marian speak, it wasn’t clear to me how to channel my faith and commitment to social justice to try to make a real difference in the world. But she put me on the path of service. I went to work for her at the Children’s Defense Fund. She sent me to her home state of South Carolina to take on the problem of black teenagers who were being incarcerated along with adults. And when I look back, everything else I’ve done — whether it was going undercover to Alabama to expose segregated academies and try to skip them of their tax exemptions, or running a legal clinic at the University of Arkansas, to represent inmates — that’s been part of my mission. Representing poor people through the Legal Services Corporation: It’s about making people’s lives better. And it taught me that, even if you’re young and you don’t have a powerful job, if you work at it and you stick with it, you can make a difference. … You know, to quote Dr. King, the time is always right to do right — no matter who you are. And when I had the great privilege of representing New York, I worked with members of our congressional delegation. We fought to bring investments and jobs to neighborhoods that needed them, to improve health care, to get cleaner air and water for low-income communities. One of the highlights was partnering with the organization, One Hundred Black Men, to create the Eagle Academy, which has been so successful — it’s grown to six schools now in New York — taking young African American and Latino men. There was always something to be done, and I had so many partners here in New York. We championed reforms to probation and drug diversion programs. We promoted specialized drug courts and juvenile programs, coming full circle with the work that I had done for Marion. So when I decided to run for president, I knew these issues had to be at the heart of my campaign. That’s where they’ve always been, that’s where they will always be. And I want to add something else: We Democrats have a special obligation: If we’re serious about our commitment to the poor, to those who need some help, including African Americans, if we continue to ask black people to vote for us, we cannot minimize the realities of the lives they lead or take their concerns for granted. You know, you can’t just show up at election time and say the right things and think that’s enough. We can’t start building relationships a few weeks before a vote. We have to demonstrate a sustained commitment to building opportunity, creating prosperity, and righting wrongs. Not just every two or four years, not just when the cameras are on and people are watching, but every single day. So here’s what I ask of you: Hold me accountable. Hold every candidate accountable. What we say matters — but what we do matters more. And you deserve leaders who will do whatever it takes to tear down all the barriers holding you back, and then replace them with those ladders of opportunities that every American deserves to have. I’m also asking all Americans to join in that effort. As Cornell Brooks, the new head of the NAACP, said in our meeting this morning: None of this is a “they” problem. It’s a “we” problem, and all of us have to admit that. And you know what? It is not an urban problem. It’s an American problem. Ending systemic racism requires contributions from all of us — especially those of us who haven’t experienced it ourselves. White Americans need to do a better job of listening when African Americans talk about the seen and unseen barriers that you face every day. We need to recognize our privilege and practice humility, rather than assume that our experiences are everyone’s experiences. All of us need to bring our skills to bare — and especially young people coming up today, who have a passion for social justice and are helping to create new ways to solve intractable problems. And we all need to try as best we can to walk in one another’s shoes. Imagine what it would be like to sit our son or daughter down and have the talk. Or if people followed us around stores or locked our car doors whenever we walked past. That kind of empathy is critical. It’s what makes it possible for people from every background, every race, every religion to come together in this great city, and to come together as one nation. It’s what makes a country like America endure. You know, I started my remarks by talking about Flint. I’m going to keep talking about Flint until the families there get the help they need — for as long as it takes. But there’s another side to the story of this tragedy. It’s the story of hundreds of union plumbers from across the country travelling to Flint to install water filters for free. It’s students at universities all over the Midwest raising funds for water deliveries and student athletes showing up in Flint to distribute supplies. It’s the United Auto Workers and General Motors donating millions. It’s money pouring in to organizations where people are donating, if you wish, to try and help the kids and the people of Flint. And I’m grateful to everyone who has responded to our request sent out to our campaign. And it’s the story of that kindergartner in Wilton, NH who lost his first tooth just a few days ago. The tooth fairy left him five dollars. I got a dime, I don’t know about you. And he said to his mother, “I want to give it so those little kids can have water.” His mom sat right down and wrote me a letter about it. To me, that’s the best of America, and it keeps me going. That sense we are all in this together. We all have vital contributions to make, and that when we come together — all of us — with a sense of shared purpose and shared humanity, we can solve any problem we face. And we can heal any divide. We can build a future that is far, far better than our past. That is my hope for our country, that is my goal for this election, and I promise to keep fighting right alongside all of you, every day, to make the United States a place where all men and all women are treated as equals — just as we are, just as we deserve to be. That is my hope for America. Thank you all very much."

In his first ""This Week"" interview since the passage of health care reform, Clinton reflected on how the bill's success made him feel like Teddy Roosevelt to Obama's FDR. And Clinton offered advice and thoughts on some of Obama's next issues -- a Supreme Court nomination, the Middle East peace process and the midterm elections. Anchor Jake Tapper asked Clinton about Limbaugh's criticism of his speech marking the upcoming 15th anniversary of the Oklahoma City bombing. In that speech, Clinton warned that ""the words we use really do matter, because there's this vast echo chamber, and they go across space and they fall on the serious and delirious alike. They fall on the connected and the unhinged alike."" On ""This Week,"" Clinton said, ""The only point I tried to make was that we ought to have a lot of political dissent -- a lot of political argument. Nobody is right all the time. But we also have to take responsibility for the possible consequences of what we say."" Clinton said he worries about threats against President Obama and the Congress. And, he worries ""about more careless language ... some of which we've seen against the Republican governor in New Jersey, Gov. Christie."" A recently leaked memo from a New Jersey teacher joked about Christie dying. ""I think we all have to be careful,"" Clinton said. ""We ought to remember [that] after Oklahoma City we learned something about the difference in disagreement and demonization."" On Derivatives: 'I Was Wrong' Clinton acknowledged that he was wrong to take what he now views as bad advice from his Treasury secretaries, Robert Rubin and Larry Summers, who told him the market for complex financial instruments known as derivatives ought to remain unregulated. ""On derivatives, yeah, I think they were wrong and I think I was wrong to take [their advice],"" Clinton said, ""because the argument on derivatives was that these things are expensive and sophisticated and only a handful of investors will buy them, and they don't need any extra protection and any extra transparency. The money they're putting up guarantees them transparency. ""The flaw in that argument,"" Clinton added, ""was that first of all sometimes people with a lot of money make stupid decisions and make it without transparency."" The former president said he also was wrong in his understanding of what a collapse in the derivative market could do to the economy. ""The most important flaw,"" he said, ""was even if less than 1 percent of the total investment community is involved in derivative exchanges, so much money was involved that if they went bad, they could affect 100 percent of the investments, and indeed 100 percent of the citizens in countries, not investors. And I was wrong about that."" He now wishes he had tried to regulate derivatives while in office, but he doesn't think he would have been successful. ""Now, I think if I had tried to regulate them, because the Republicans were the majority in the Congress, they would have stopped it,"" he said. ""But I wish I should have been caught trying. I mean, that was a mistake I made."" Bill Clinton's Supreme Court Nominee Advice: Robe Not Required Clinton said a robe isn't necessarily a requirement for being nominated to the Supreme Court. Asked about his advice for President Obama as he selects a nominee to be the next Supreme Court justice, Clinton said he hopes the president will ""take a look at somebody who hasn't been a judge."" ""The important thing,"" Clinton said, ""is that you think they're smart and they're competent and they understand the lives of ordinary people."" When asked if he or his wife, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, would be suited for the job, Clinton said at 63, he's too old and, ""I'd like to see him put someone in their late 40s, early 50s on the court and someone with a lot of energy for the job."" Hillary Clinton, he said, would have the same advice. Diversity, he suggested, should also be a consideration. ""My advice to him would be to first of all see what the court is missing,"" Clinton said. ""Does it matter if he puts a Catholic or a Jewish person or someone of another faith on a court? ... There would be no Protestants on the Supreme Court. Does that matter? Does there need to be another woman on the court? Should there be some other group represented?"" Ecstatic Over Health Care Passage: Felt Like Teddy Roosevelt On the recent health care reform bill, Clinton said he felt like ""Teddy Roosevelt would have felt if he'd still been alive in the 1930s seeing his cousin Franklin being able to sign legislation in areas that he had advocated."" Clinton was thrilled that it passed and that he and Hillary Clinton personally lobbied for passage before the final vote on the bill. ""She and I were ecstatic,"" he said. Clinton expects more changes in the bill. ""They'll have to keep working on it and putting more cost drivers in it to take the cost down,"" he said. ""But it's a big, big step. And it's a wonderful thing for the country."" Midterm Elections: Another 1994? Clinton said the current political environment reminds him ""a little bit"" of 1994, a year in which Democrats lost majorities in both houses of Congress in a Republican landslide. ""I think that the dissent is just as intense, if not more intense,"" he said. ""But I think the outcome of the election is likely to be far less dramatic than it was in '94."" Clinton expects Republicans to make some gains, but ""I don't think they'll win either house."" Back in 1994, congressional Democrats put their jobs on the line to vote for President Clinton's economic package. The recent health care vote, he said, was similar, but the country is different now. ""We are culturally a different country,"" he said. ""We are more diverse. We're more communitarian. That is, we understand we have to solve a lot of these problems together."" Middle East Peace Process Clinton said he was reluctant to offer public advice to President Obama regarding the Middle East peace process, so as not to foreclose his options. But he added, ""We need to do something to deprive both sides of any excuse not to engage in serious negotiations."" If President Obama puts a peace plan on the table, Clinton said he will ""strongly support it."" The argument against the administration putting forward a peace plan, Clinton said, is that the current Israeli government ""almost certainly would reject it."" That, he said, could ""make us look weak."" But the Obama administration, Clinton said, ""may decide it's more important to have clarity and to do something that will be an action-forcing event to put them back to the table."""
12,politifact13193,0,http://minnesota.cbslocal.com/2016/07/09/philando-stops/,Philando Castile Had Been Stopped 52 Times By Police,"MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — When Philando Castile saw the flashing lights in his rearview mirror the night he got shot, it wasn’t unusual. He had been pulled over at least 52 times in recent years in and around the Twin Cities and given citations for minor offenses including speeding, driving without a muffler and not wearing a seat belt. He was assessed at least $6,588 in fines and fees, although more than half of the total 86 violations were dismissed, court records show. Was Castile an especially bad driver or just unlucky? Or was he targeted by officers who single out black motorists like him for such stops, as several of his family members have alleged? The answer may never be known, but Castile’s stop for a broken tail light Wednesday ended with him fatally shot by a suburban St. Paul police officer, and Castile’s girlfriend livestreaming the chilling aftermath. The shooting has added a new impetus to a national debate on racial profiling; a day after Castile died, a black Army veteran killed five officers in Dallas at a demonstration over Castile’s killing and another fatal police shooting, in Louisiana. The Castile video “is pretty horrific,” said Gavin Kearney, who in 2003 co-authored a report to the Minnesota Legislature on racial profiling in the state. “There are things we don’t know about it. But we know there are certain assumptions and biases — whether explicit or implicit — about black men that affect how police officers interpret their actions. And we know white drivers are less likely to be pulled over.” Court records dating to 2002 show Castile, a 32-year-old school cafeteria supervisor, averaged more than three traffic stops per year and received citations for misdemeanors or petty misdemeanors. Many charges were dismissed, but Castile pleaded guilty to some, mostly for driving after his license was revoked and driving with no proof of insurance. However, those two charges also were the most frequently dismissed, along with failing to wear a seat belt. The records show no convictions for more serious crimes. No recent information is available on the racial breakdown of drivers stopped or ticketed by police in Falcon Heights, the mostly white suburb where the shooting occurred, or in other Minnesota towns. Minnesota is not among the handful of states that require police to keep such data. But in 2001, the Legislature asked for a racial profiling study and it fell to Kearney, then at the Institute on Race & Poverty at the University of Minnesota Law School, to conduct it. His study, using information supplied voluntarily by 65 law enforcement jurisdictions in the state, found a strong likelihood that racial and ethnic bias played a role in traffic stop policies and practices. Overall, officers stopped minority drivers at greater rates than whites and searched them at greater rates, but found contraband in those searches at lower rates than whites. The analysis found the pattern was more pronounced in suburban areas. In Fridley, New Hope, Plymouth, Sauk Rapids and Savage combined, blacks were stopped about 310 percent more often than expected. The St. Anthony Police Department, which employs the officer who shot Castile, did not participate in the study. St. Anthony officials have not commented on Castile’s stop since shortly after the shooting. It was not immediately clear how much money governments in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area generate from traffic violations. A U.S. Department of Justice investigation following the 2014 police shooting death of Michael Brown, a black, unarmed 18-year-old, in Ferguson, Missouri, found law enforcement efforts were focused on generating revenue for that city. Most of the tickets and fines were going to blacks. Castile’s girlfriend, Diamond Reynolds, a passenger in the car, said the two officers who stopped them said the vehicle had a broken tail light. She said one of the officers shot him “for no apparent reason” after he reached for his ID. Valerie Castile said she thinks her son “was just black in the wrong place.” Minnesota Gov. Mark Dayton said he did not believe it would have happened to a white motorist. The officer who shot Castile, Jeronimo Yanez, is Latino. His lawyer, Thomas Kelly, said Saturday that his client reacted to the fact that Castile had a gun, not his race, though Kelly would not discuss what led Yanez to initiate the traffic stop. “Police understand the concerns about choices made about who gets stopped and what happens when they get stopped,” said Darrel Stephens, executive director of the Major Cities Chiefs Association. But the statistics can’t simply be attributed to racial bias among police. “When people call the police, they provide a description of somebody engaged in a crime. The police respond to those descriptions,” said Stephens, a former Charlotte, North Carolina, police chief. “That counts for part of the disproportionality that we see in those numbers.” Last year, the President’s Task Force on 21st Century Policing recommended police departments collect and analyze demographic data on all stops, searches and seizures. Nationally, 13 percent of black drivers were pulled over at least once in 2011, compared with 10 percent of the white drivers, according to a survey by the U.S. Justice Department’s Bureau of Justice Statistics. The survey shows 68 percent of black drivers considered the stops legitimate compared with 84 percent of white drivers. The precise reasons why certain motorists are pulled over more than others are difficult to identify, said Lorie Fridell, an associate professor of criminology at the University of South Florida, who trains police departments through a program called Fair and Impartial Policing. “Our implicit biases are most likely to impact us when we’re facing ambiguous situations,” Fridell said. “A person reaching into a pocket is ambiguous. If I, as a white, middle-aged woman, reach into my pocket most people aren’t going to experience fear. For a black male with dreadlocks, that ambiguous action would produce fear in many people."

But I think that fear must be nothing compared to the fear the first graders in Sandy Hook Elementary School felt as their lives ended in a hail of bullets. The fear that those children who survived the massacre must feel every time they remember their teachers stacking them into closets and bathrooms, whispering that they loved them, so that love would be the last thing the students heard if the gunman found them. On Wednesday, a minority of senators gave into fear and blocked common-sense legislation that would have made it harder for criminals and people with dangerous mental illnesses to get hold of deadly firearms — a bill that could prevent future tragedies like those in Newtown, Conn., Aurora, Colo., Blacksburg, Va., and too many communities to count. Some of the senators who voted against the background-check amendments have met with grieving parents whose children were murdered at Sandy Hook, in Newtown. Some of the senators who voted no have also looked into my eyes as I talked about my experience being shot in the head at point-blank range in suburban Tucson two years ago, and expressed sympathy for the 18 other people shot besides me, 6 of whom died. These senators have heard from their constituents — who polls show overwhelmingly favored expanding background checks. And still these senators decided to do nothing. Shame on them. I watch TV and read the papers like everyone else. We know what we’re going to hear: vague platitudes like “tough vote” and “complicated issue.” I was elected six times to represent southern Arizona, in the State Legislature and then in Congress. I know what a complicated issue is; I know what it feels like to take a tough vote. This was neither. These senators made their decision based on political fear and on cold calculations about the money of special interests like the National Rifle Association, which in the last election cycle spent around $25 million on contributions, lobbying and outside spending."

""Gun violence,"" she wrote, ""is by far the leading cause of death for young African-American men, outstripping the next nine causes of death combined."" We wondered whether this is correct, so we took a closer look. We found the relevant data on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website. Using this search form, we collected data on the 10 most common causes of death for African-American men and boys between the ages of 15 and 24, for 2014. Rank Cause of death Number of deaths Number gun-related 1st Homicide 2,416 2,256 2nd Unintentional injuries 1,135 47 3rd Suicide 448 230 4th Heart disease 172 -- 5th Cancer 161 Featured Fact-check Says Cracker Barrel’s name has racist origins and its logo depicts a whip. -- 6th HIV 52 -- 7th Chronic lower respiratory diseases 47 -- 8th Congenital anomalies 38 -- 9th Anemia 33 -- 10th Diabetes 33 -- Total, 2nd through 9th place -- 2,119 -- So even if you look only at gun-related homicides, there were 2,256 of those in 2014, compared to 2,119 deaths in the next nine categories combined. This makes Clinton’s statement correct. If you add in the accidents and suicides related to guns, the gap between gun-related deaths and other types of deaths expands even further. There were 2,533 gun-related deaths in all 10 categories combined, compared to 2,002 deaths in the top 10 categories that had nothing to do with guns. We should note that this statement is dependent on the age range chosen. For instance, the statement is not correct for African-American boys between age 10 and 14. There were 38 gun-related homicides in that age and racial group in 2014, plus 10 gun suicides and three unintentional injuries caused by guns, for a total of 51. By contrast, the top 10 causes of death for that age and racial group included 271 deaths that had nothing to do with guns, such as diseases. That said, we think Clinton’s definition of ""young"" as 15-24 is a reasonable one. Our ruling Clinton said, ""Gun violence is by far the leading cause of death for young African-American men, outstripping the next nine causes of death combined."" As long as you define ""young"" as being between the ages of 15 and 24, Clinton’s statement is accurate, according to CDC data. We rate the statement True."
15,politifact9107,0,http://wfpl.org/post/mitch-mcconnell-alison-lundergan-grimes-have-sharp-differences-campaign-finance-rules,"Mitch McConnell, Alison Lundergan Grimes Have 'Sharp Differences' on Campaign Finance Rules","Republican Senator Mitch McConnell and Democratic challenger Alison Lundergan Grimes sit on opposite sides of the debate about the role of money in U.S. elections. A deluge of campaign cash is playing a significant role in Kentucky’s Senate race thus far. The money raised by the campaigns and outside groups is expected to top the $100 million mark and go down as the most expensive in U.S. history. More than any lawmaker, McConnell is the face of loosening—if not, eliminating—campaign finance regulations. For over a decade the GOP leader has espoused that money and free speech are synonymous. He has filed legal briefs urging the Supreme Court to reaffirm its Citizens United decision and supports a controversial case to further deregulate contribution limits placed on individuals. In a March 17 e-mail to supporters, Grimes took a strong stance against the influence wealthy donors are having and calls out McConnell as the chief architect and beneficiary of that system. “Special interest money has already flooded into Mitch McConnell’s campaign,” Grimes said. “He’s the number one recipient of contributions from lobbyists this cycle and his Karl Rove-affiliated Super PACs are clogging the Commonwealth’s airwaves with negative attack ads. Enough is enough—our democracy is too important to be auctioned off to the highest bidder.” Grimes has played it safe on the campaign trail when faced with thornier issues outside of core Democratic principles, such as raising the minimum wage. But given the left’s apoplectic reaction to the Roberts Court’s dismantling limitations and the rise of super PACs, her position is receiving applause from watchdog groups. “It’s very good that Alison Grimes has come out in support of a policy that puts regular people in charge of government again,” says David Donnelly, who is executive director of Public Campaign Action Fund. “She understands that money in politics drowns out the voices of every day Kentuckians. This is a sharp difference between her and McConnell, someone who is advocating the make the problem worse.” The Grimes campaign message also directs voters to sign a petition calling on Congress to “stop special interest billionaires,” that has the support of red state Democratic senators such as Joe Donnelly of Indiana and Joe Manchin of West Virginia. In the 2014 election cycle, there are almost 1,000 registered super PACs that have generated over $141 million and spent more than $24.8 million on races. According to the non-partisan Center for Responsive Politics, the pro-McConnell super PAC Kentuckians for Strong Leadership is among the ranks among the top ten groups in this year’s races. Democrats and liberal activists decrying the influence of money in politics have themselves pointed out its limitations in Kentucky’s Senate race. McConnell has spent over half of the $20 million he’s raised this cycle and he has a number of outside groups spending millions in advertisements supporting his re-election. Yet McConnell’s approval ratings remain terribly low and Grimes either leads or ties the GOP leader in most polling. Former FEC Chairman Michael Toner says despite arguments that the wealthy are purchasing American elections, those independent expenditure committees haven’t always worked out for candidates. “One reason the federal courts over the years have not found a corruption threat at the independent spending is that sometimes it’s not that effective in directly advancing a candidate’s interest,” he says. “A lot of candidates who spend more money than their opponents whether out of their own pocket or let’s say supported by major outside groups, their track record in winning elections is not that good to be honest. We’ve seen a lot of multi-millionaire candidates who are defeated in various races. Now to be sure some are also elected, but by now means is the candidate with the most money spent on their behalf assured of being elected.” Grimes has raised $4.5 million since entering the race last year and been all over the country at fundraisers with big name Democratic donors. She outpaced McConnell’s money machine during the third quarter and Democratic-affiliated groups have also spent money attacking McConnell in television ads. The McConnell campaign was quick to point out that while Grimes is criticizing Citizens United, she is also benefiting from attack ads against the senator from outside liberal groups who praise her position. “Like Barack Obama, Alison Lundergan Grimes is obviously much more concerned with political convenience than Constitutional protections,” McConnell campaign spokeswoman Allison Moore told WFPL. “The sad part is that she apparently sees no irony in the fact the special interest group who successfully persuaded her to embrace trampling on our First Amendment rights in the name of money in politics is the same one running hundreds of thousands of dollars of advertising on her behalf.” The top expenditures in 2014 have been super PACs with liberal viewpoints such as Senate Majority PAC, which has slammed McConnell in TV ads. Asked about Grimes’ wealthy donors, Donnelly says all elected officials and candidates are implicated but that what lawmakers do in Washington matters. “The real distinction is what are you going to do to clean it up and propose pro-actively to make the system better,” he says. “And on that score voters know in Alison Grimes they have someone who is going to champion the issue and that in Mitch McConnell who is going to make the problem worse.”"

Sarah Palin Born: February 11, 1964, Sandpoint, Idaho Education: B.S., University of Idaho, 1987 Elected offices: Wasilla, Alaska, City Council member, 1992-96 Wasilla mayor, 1996-2002 Elected governor of Alaska, 2006 Professional career: Television sports reporter, 1987-89; co-owner, commercial fishing operation, 1988-2007; owner, snow machine, watercraft and all-terrain vehicle business, 1994-97; chairwoman, Alaska Oil and Gas Conservation Commission, 2003-04. Married: To Todd Palin; five children. The oldest, Track, serves in the U.S. Army; the youngest, Trig, has Down syndrome. Sources: Almanac of American Politics, CNN  In 2003 and 2004, she chaired the state Oil and Gas Conservation Commission, which regulates Alaska's oil and gas resources. Widely seen as a political outsider who stayed at arm's length from her party establishment, she defeated two political insiders in 2006 to become the youngest, and first female, governor in the state's history. As governor, she won praise for backing tough ethical standards for politicians. During the first legislative session after her election, her administration passed a state ethics law overhaul. But her term was not without controversy. A legislative investigation is looking into allegations that Palin fired Alaska's public safety commissioner because he refused to fire the governor's former brother-in-law, a state trooper. She denied wrongdoing. An outspoken anti-abortion Republican, Palin has spoken out about her fifth child, who was diagnosed in utero with Down syndrome. ""We knew through early testing he would face special challenges, and we feel privileged that God would entrust us with this gift and allow us unspeakable joy as he entered our lives,"" the Republican National Committee quoted her as saying. ""We have faith that every baby is created for good purpose and has potential to make this world a better place. We are truly blessed."" She is married to her high-school sweetheart, a commercial fisherman. The two eloped in 1988, to save money on a big wedding, a year after she graduated from the University of Idaho, where she studied journalism and political science, according to the Almanac of American Politics. Watch details on elopement » Palin is an avid hunter and a lifetime member of the National Rifle Association. As millions of Americans began searching for information on her Friday, her official Web site as governor wasn't the only one getting flooded with traffic. Traffic also spiked at sites showcasing pictures from 1984, when she wore the crown of Miss Wasilla and competed in the Miss Alaska contest. She was born in Idaho, and her parents moved to Alaska when she was 3 months old. Some similarities between Palin and McCain were clear Friday: Both have been termed mavericks, and both have taken on the GOP establishment at times. McCain has a son who has served in Iraq; Palin has one heading there soon. So does her vice presidential opponent, Sen. Joe Biden. For all that is known about her, Palin now becomes the most prominent unknown quantity in the presidential race. Her lack of experience on national political issues, including foreign policy and homeland security, and her only brief experience as governor open clear lines of attack for the Obama campaign. Watch Democrats respond to the Palin pick » Then again, McCain's surprising announcement Friday and the intense focus it drew threatened to slow Obama's post-convention momentum in a dramatic way. No stranger to being a first in Alaska, Palin now faces being a first on a national level: the first female No. 2 on the GOP presidential ticket and only the second female on a major party ticket, after Democrat Geraldine Ferraro more than 20 years ago. Schumer described McCain's choice as a ""Hail Mary pass."" Whether that's true has yet to be seen. But what's not in question is that in entering the race, Sarah Palin changes the game."

U.S and Dutch soldiers drive along a dusty road in a village in Baluchi pass in Uruzgan province, Afghanistan November 1, 2007. REUTERS/Goran Tomasevic “This proposal is coming before the secretary this week,” Pentagon press secretary Geoff Morrell said. “He will take it and consider it thoroughly before approving it.” Violence has surged in Afghanistan over the past two years, with the hardline Islamist Taliban fighting a guerrilla war in the south and east and carrying out high-profile suicide and car bombings across the country. For months, Gates has pressed NATO allies to provide more troops for Afghanistan. But if the Pentagon chief backs the proposal, it will show Washington has concluded it will have to provide a large share of any extra combat forces. Gates ordered a boost in U.S. forces early last year in response to the violence and the United States currently has some 27,000 troops in Afghanistan -- a record high. Around half the U.S. troops serve in a 40,000-strong NATO-led security assistance force while the rest conduct missions ranging from counter-terrorism to training Afghan troops. While NATO says it thwarted last year’s attempted Taliban spring offensive, overall violence is up 27 percent over a year ago and it has risen by 60 percent in the southern province of Helmand, the U.S. military said last month. IN PLACE BY APRIL Morrell said most of the Marines would go to southern Afghanistan, where British, Canadian and Dutch troops have done much of the fighting. “The idea is to get this in place to prevent, as we did last spring, another attempt by the Taliban to come back,” he told reporters. “The timing is that they would be in place by April. This is a one-time seven-month deployment.” After meeting allies in Scotland last month, Gates signaled a shift away from pressing NATO nations to make politically difficult decisions to provide combat troops. He suggested the allies could help with other areas of the mission of rebuilding Afghanistan. But that shift means the United States must shoulder more of the combat burden. “The commander needs additional forces there. Our allies are not in a position to provide them so we are now looking at perhaps carrying a bit of that additional load,” Morrell said. U.S.-led forces ousted the Taliban government in late 2001 in response to the September 11 attacks on the United States. Morrell said the plan to send the Marines would be contained in a schedule of deployment proposals presented to Gates on Friday. The plan would involve the deployment of a unit called a Marine Air Ground Task Force to fight in southern Afghanistan, and a Marine battalion to train Afghan forces. The Pentagon’s Joint Staff developed the plan after a request from Adm. William Fallon, the top U.S. commander for the Middle East, and it has the support of Adm. Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, a U.S. military official said."
18,politifact12627,0,http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-05-09/trump-s-tough-talk-on-hedge-fund-taxes-doesn-t-match-his-plan,Trump's Tough Talk on Hedge-Fund Taxes Doesn't Match His Plan,"Donald Trump said “hedge fund guys are getting away with murder” when he called for ending a lucrative tax advantage for investment managers, but his published tax plan would give them an even bigger break. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee for president, has called for abolishing the special tax treatment that applies to “carried interest,” the share of investment funds’ profits that are paid to fund managers. Currently, carried interest is treated as capital-gains income, which makes it eligible for a tax rate as low as 23.8 percent -- much lower than the current top individual income tax rate of 39.6 percent. But the plan published on Trump’s website would also create an entirely new tax rate -- just 15 percent -- for individuals who get income from business partnerships. That category includes most managers at hedge funds, private-equity funds and venture capital funds. In other words, if Trump’s proposals came to pass, many investment managers’ tax rates would go from 23.8 percent to 15 percent. “He’d be doing me a favor,” said Scott Fearon, the president of Crown Capital Management, a hedge fund and investment fund in Greenbrae, California. “He’d be cutting my taxes quite a bit.” Spokesmen for Trump’s campaign didn’t respond to requests for comment in e-mails and telephone calls. On Sunday, Trump said on ABC’s “This Week” that if he’s elected, he expects his tax proposals would change during negotiations with Congress. Ultimately, tax rates for high earners might be higher than he has suggested, he said, but he’d try to preserve proposals to lower taxes on the middle class and on businesses. He didn’t mention his partnership proposal specifically. “I will try and keep everything,” Trump said. “What I really want is lower on business, because business -- we’re the highest-taxed nation in the world. And I want lower on the middle class.” Trump’s position on hedge fund taxes resurfaced Thursday when he named Steven Mnuchin, a hedge fund manager, to lead his national fundraising. Trump, a billionaire businessman and former reality-television star, had been largely self-funding his campaign. Mnuchin declined to comment on Trump’s attacks on carried interest and hedge funds. But he said he’s already gotten calls from fellow hedge-fund managers and others on Wall Street expressing their support for the candidate. Rate Cut Some analysts have pointed out previously that the plan on Trump’s website would actually benefit investment managers. The Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center found that under Trump’s plan, “carried interest would be taxed at a much lower rate than under current law.” Alan Viard, a tax policy scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said of Trump’s proposal: “It’s clearly a tax-rate cut for private equity, hedge funds and venture capital.” Trump’s 15 percent rate would apply to so-called “pass-through” business structures, including partnerships, limited liability companies and sole proprietorships. For tax purposes, such businesses pass their earnings through to their owners, who then pay tax at rates that reach 39.6 percent under current law. Saying the current system “stifles small businesses,” the campaign has pitched its 15 percent rate as a boon for them. Trump also has proposed a top income tax rate of 15 percent for large corporations, which currently are subject to a top statutory rate of 35 percent. And he has called for cutting individual income-tax rates across the board as well, taking the top rate from 39.6 to 25 percent. Debt Increase While Trump has proposed limiting the value of certain individual tax deductions to help pay for those cuts, various analyses suggest his plan would reduce federal revenue by about $10 trillion over its first decade. While it would improve incentives for U.S. taxpayers to work, save and invest, it could increase the national debt by almost 80 percent of gross domestic product by 2036 unless it’s accompanied by large spending cuts, according to the Tax Policy Center’s analysis. The broad language of Trump’s proposed 15 percent tax rate for pass-through partners will get investment managers’ attention, said Bill Burnham, the founder of Inductive Capital, a hedge fund and investment firm in Reno, Nevada. “You can bet your last dollar that every hedge, private-equity and venture-capital fund under the sun would pass through as much income as they could,” Burnham said. But he also said the proposal to treat small businesses the same as giant private-equity and hedge funds “seems like a big loophole that would quickly close at some point.” Bashing carried interest emerged as a popular theme in the 2016 presidential campaign. Democrats Hillary Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont joined Trump in calling for its end, as did former Republican contenders Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and Jeb Bush. Hedge funds, investment pools open only to wealthy investors, engage heavily in short-term trading and tend to have shorter-term gains. That means their carried interest often doesn’t qualify for the 23.8 percent rate, which is reserved for gains on assets held for a year or more. By contrast, private-equity funds put money into longer-term investments. Trump’s proposal to abolish the current treatment of carried interest is aimed at “speculative partnerships that do not grow businesses or create jobs and are not risking their own capital,” which may not include private-equity funds. Regardless, both types of funds would be in line for the proposed 15 percent rate under Trump’s proposal. But that doesn’t mean the candidate won’t change it. “As far as Donald’s plan, it’s not a plan without far more details,” said entrepreneur Mark Cuban, the owner of the Dallas Mavericks basketball team and a star of ABC’s “Shark Tank” television program. “These are talking points. Nothing more.” — With assistance by Dakin Campbell"

20,politifact11855,0,http://www.popularmechanics.com/space/satellites/a1782/4218443/,China's Space Threat: How Missiles Could Target U.S. Satellites,"At 5:28 PM EST on Jan. 11, 2007, a satellite arced over southern China. It was small—just 6 ft. long—a tiny object in the heavens, steadily bleeping its location to ground stations below, just as it had every day for the past seven years. And then it was gone, transformed into a cloud of debris hurtling at nearly 16,000 mph along the main thoroughfare used by orbiting spacecraft. It was not the start of the world's first war in space, but it could have been. It was just a test: The satellite was a defunct Chinese weather spacecraft. And the country that destroyed it was China. According to reports, a mobile launcher at the Songlin test facility near Xichang, in Sichuan province, lofted a multistage solid-fuel missile topped with a kinetic kill vehicle. Traveling nearly 18,000 mph, the kill vehicle intercepted the sat and—boom—obliterated it. ""It was almost just a dead-reckoning flight with little control over the intercept path,"" says Phillip S. Clark, an independent British authority who has written widely on the Chinese and Russian space programs. For China, a nation that has already sent humans into space and developed intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), the technology involved in the test was hardly remarkable. But as a demonstration of a rising military posture, it was a surprisingly aggressive act, especially since China has long pushed for an international treaty banning space weapons. ""The move was a dangerous step toward the abyss of weaponizing space,"" says Theresa Hitchens, director of the Center for Defense Information, an independent defense research group in Washington, D.C. ""China held the moral high ground about space, and that test re-energized the China hawks in Congress. If we're not careful, space could become the new Wild West. You don't just go and blow things up there."" In fact, after the Chinese test, India publicly stepped up its development of antiÂ­satellite technology. And some Israeli officials have argued that, given China's record of selling missile technology to Iran, Israel should develop its own program. INTERNATIONAL THREAT For many countries, the most disturbing aspect of the test was not the potentially destabilizing sat kill, but the resulting debris, which poses a serious threat to every satellite in orbit, as well as to the International Space Station. ""Space debris is a huge problem,"" says Laura Grego, staff scientist in the Global Security Program at the Union of Concerned Scientists. ""A 1-centimeter object is very hard to track but can do considerable damage if it collides with any spacecraft at a high rate of speed."" Think of a shotgun pellet traveling at 10 times the speed of a bullet, smashing into a device built to be as light as possible. And then consider that China's antisatellite (ASAT) test produced as many as 35,000 of these pellets, or pieces of debris, in the 1-cm range. Nearly 1500 pieces were 10 cm and larger. Although the United States knew that China was planning to test ASAT technology, administration officials—reluctant to disclose the level of U.S. surveillance—chose to say nothing. China failed two or three times before successfully launching the missile in January. All the attempts were observed by the U.S. Air Force satellite system known as the Defense Support Program. Infrared telescopes on these 33-ft.-high defense satellites can spot the plumes from rockets launched anywhere on Earth. Battlefield: Space 1] Songlin test facility, near Xichang, Sichuan province, China. Publicly available satellite images of the facility were censored by China prior to the test; immediately following, they were declassified. 2] Experts believe a four-stage, solidÂ­-fuel launch vehicle—thought by American officials to be based on China's KT-2—boosted the kill vehicle into orbit. 3] The Feng-Yun 1C target vehicle was launched May 10, 1999, with a two-year active life span. The 1650-pound polar-orbiting weather satellite was equipped with two 10-band scanning radiometers for Earth observation. 4] The kinetic-energy kill vehicle was traveling nearly 18,000 mph when it struck the satellite. 5] The collision blasted debris throughout low Earth orbit. Within 7 hours, a band of debris had spread halfway around the globe. Some details of China's ASAT test are classified. Our artist relied on published reports, declassified information and comparable technology to create this graphic. The Chinese kinetic kill vehicle is based on Raytheon's Exoatmospheric Kill Vehicle. (Diagram by Golden Section Graphics. Inset satellite photograph by Digital Globe.) NASA AMERICA'S OWN SAT KILLS Every industrialized country relies on satellites every day, for everything from computer networking technology to telecommunications, navigation, weather prediction, television and radio. This makes satellites especially vulnerable targets. Imagine the U.S. military suddenly without guidance for its soldiers and weapons systems, and its civilians without storm warnings or telephones. Some satellites, however, are at greater risk than others. Most spacecraft -- including spy sats -- are in low Earth orbit, which stretches 1240 miles into space. As the Chinese test proved, such targets could be hit with medium-range missiles tipped with crude kill devices. GPS satellites are far higher, orbiting at about 12,600 miles. Many communications sats are in the 22,000-mile range. Destroying them requires a much more powerful and sophisticated long-range ballistic missile -- yet it can be done. ""You'd need a sky-sweeping capability to comprehensively negate a space support system that is scattered all over,"" says John Pike, a space analyst at GlobalSecurity.org. ""You'd need ICBM-size boosters -- hundreds of them."" Such an all-out satellite war would render space useless for decades to come. ""There'd be so much debris up there,"" Clark says, ""that it wouldn't be safe to put anything up in space."" The United States and Russia, the two countries with proven ASAT capabilities, have long steered clear of satellites as military targets. Even during the Cold War spy sats were hands-off; the consequences of destroying them were greater than those of unwelcome surveillance. ""The consensus,"" Clark says, ""was that anybody could look at anybody else."" Diagram: China's antisatellite strike took place at an altitude of 537 miles, which places the international spacecraft depicted below well within range of China's space arsenal. Nevertheless, the U.S. military has spent decades designing weapons capable of killing other countries' satellites. The crudest American ASAT test, code-named Starfish Prime, took place in 1962, when the U.S. Air Force detonated a 1.4-megaton nuclear weapon at an altitude of 250 miles. The explosion, which occurred about 800 miles west of Hawaii, disabled at least six U.S. and foreign satellites -- roughly a third of the world's low Earth orbit total. The resulting electromagnetic pulse knocked out 300 streetlights in Oahu. Clearly, nukes worked as ASAT weapons, but far too indiscriminately. To develop a more surgical capability, the Air Force launched Project Mudflap, which was designed to destroy individual Soviet satellites with missiles. But inaccurate space-guidance systems plagued early tests. Then, on May 23, 1963, the Air Force pulled off a successful intercept with a modified Nike-Zeus ballistic missile launched from Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands. It took out a rendezvous and docking target for NASA's Gemini missions at an altitude of 150 miles. Over the next several decades the Air Force graduated to more sophisticated air-launched missiles that could hit targets with far better accuracy. In 1985 the United States destroyed an American solar observation satellite using a three-stage, heat-seeking miniature vehicle fired from an F-15 fighter jet. That test, like the Chinese one earlier this year, used a kinetic kill vehicle that spewed debris into space. Funding for the program was cancelled before the air-launched system could be perfected. That same year, at the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico, the Air Force began operating the powerful Mid-Infrared Chemical Laser. In 1997, it was used to temporarily blind sensors on an Air Force missile-launch and tracking satellite. The sat remained intact; no debris was created. And no laser tests have been conducted since. However, the current federal budget includes funding for a laser to be fired at a low Earth orbit sat from the Starfire Optical Range at Kirtland Air Force Base, in New Mexico, later this year. Some $400 million has been spent in recent years to develop another sophisticated kill vehicle -- a three-stage missile that smacks an enemy's craft with a sheet of Mylar plastic, disabling it without producing any debris. It has yet to be fully tested, and would only work on satellites in low Earth orbit; communication and GPS sats are too high. Destroying an adversary's satellites has far-reaching implications. Do you take out only military sats or so-called civilian ones, too? Nearly every satellite has dual uses: A civilian weather satellite used for tracking hurricanes also could watch military movements. Many satellites are used by multiple nations. And once a nation disables an adversary's satellites, it puts its own in peril. As Charles Vick, a senior analyst at GlobalÂ­Security says, ""It's an act of war."" U.S. Sat Kill Arsenal --Davin Coburn 1] Perhaps the most spectacular test -- known as Starfish Prime -- occurred on July 9, 1962, when a 1.4-megaton nuclear warhead was detonated 250 miles above the Pacific. Radiation and electromagnetic pulses disabled at least six satellites and created an eerie, artificial glow for 20 minutes. 2] The U.S. conducted its only direct antisat test in 1985, when an F-15 climbed to 80,000 ft., then fired a three-stage missile. It caught up to a 17,500-mph Solwind solar observation satellite at an altitude of nearly 300 miles over Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. 3] In 1997 the U.S. Army hover-tested a kinetic energy weapon that could act like a space-age fly swatter. The kill vehicle extends a Mylar sheet to disable satellites without destroying them. The military found the technology too messy, and eventually canceled the program. 4] The XSS-11 microsatellite isn't an antisat -- but it could be. First launched in April 2005, the spacecraft is designed to circumnavigate targets and relay diagnostic data. Some experts note that it wouldn't be difficult to reprogram the craft to ram into enemy targets. SENDING A MESSAGE So why did China risk provoking international hostility? The country's government has been opaque. ""The experiment is not targeted at any other country,"" said a foreign ministry spokeswoman in Beijing. Some experts think at least part of China's motivation lies in an unclassified 2006 U.S. report on the future of military activities in space. The document reaffirms that ""The United States considers space capabilities ... vital to its national interests. Consistent with this policy, the United States will: preserve its rights, capabilities, and freedom of action in space; dissuade or deter others from either impeding those rights or developing capabilities intended to do so ... and deny, if necessary, adversaries the use of space capabilities hostile to U.S. national interests."" The United States ""basically said it has the right to restrict the use of space to only its allies,"" Clark says. Adds Jeffrey G. Lewis, an arms control expert at the New America Foundation: ""Much of the world was appalled at the tone of the policy. One British newspaper columnist basically said it made space the 51st state."" In that context, some experts say, the Chinese test was an effort to force the issue, to show the United States the potential consequences of refusing to negotiate a favorable treaty on the military use of space. ""The U.S. was restricting all these arms treaties,"" says Michael O'Hanlon, a senior fellow in security studies at the Brookings Institution, a Washington, D.C., think tank. ""For the Chinese, [the test] was an effort to deal from a position of strength."" Pike believes China may have another rationale for flexing its space muscle: Taiwan. China has long yearned to reabsorb the breakaway island state, which the United States has pledged to defend. In the short term, Pike says, China has only two strategies that could lead to a Taiwan takeover. It could bluff the U.S. in a nuclear confrontation, or it could try something altogether different: Fire medium-range missiles from mobile launchers, just as it did in the January test, and take out America's low-flying imaging satellites. Doing so might blind U.S. military planners long enough for Chinese military forces to gain a foothold on the island. ""The Chinese stage these big amphibious exercises off Taiwan all the time. One day, maybe it'll be real,"" Pike says. ""Either the U.S. will get there quickly enough to stop them or the Chinese will win the race and there won't be the American political resolve to kick them out. All the Chinese would need is time."" A half-dozen sats, Pike says -- that's all it would take. ""Those satellites are low-hanging fruit. It's a no-brainer."" In that scenario, the ASAT test was not really about China showing the United States its capability. It was about China confirming that its own war plan is feasible. AMERICA'S TRUMP CARD The long-term ramifications of the test will take years to play out, but, for now, few observers think China scored any gains. ""It was a mistake,"" O'Hanlon says. It fueled American hard-liners who want to restrict American technological cooperation with China. And, ""It doesn't help China's case saying it isn't a threatening military power,"" Vick says. ""It is a threat, and the test showed that."" Whether the United States suddenly accelerates its ASAT capability beyond the testing phase remains to be seen. The country is in the midst of a war; budgets are already tight. Russia is not perceived as a threat and China has only 60 satellites -- few of these are worth shooting down. America's most robust ASAT weapons were not designed for destroying satellites at all -- they are missiles developed and operated by the Missile Defense Agency (MDA), formerly known as the Strategic Defense Initiative. All U.S. ballistic missiles are actually dual-use, and while their ability to shoot down incoming rockets has been proven only in tests, it would be easy to direct them against any low Earth orbit satellite. Twenty-four MDA missiles are operational in Alaska and California, far more than would be needed, Pike says, to handle any immediate ASAT needs. There is, he says, ""just nothing to shoot at."" For now, that is. The militarization of space has long been debated. With one blown-up old weather satellite, China has made the prospect of a new arms race far more likely. It showed the world that it is willing to go toe-to-toe up in the final frontier. Waste Mismanagement IMPACT + ONE DAY It takes only 24 hours for debris to spread along the destroyed satellite's sun-synchronous polar orbit. The force of the impact drives debris into higher and lower orbits, but most of the wreckage remains at the satellite's original altitude. JULY 2007 JANUARY 2008 It's called the Kessler Syndrome -- the point at which low Earth orbit becomes so crowded with debris that collisions render space unusable. ""Debris accumulates over time and takes decades to decay,"" says Dr. T.S. Kelso of the Center for Space Standards and Innovation. ""We can't track the smaller pieces, so there is even more out there than we know."" The graphic at left illustrates the density of junk in orbit up to an altitude of 22,000 miles -- and Kessler's looming threat. -- Erin McCarthy The debris ring broadens and begins to mix with satellites and the abundant trash in low Earth orbit, which extends to an altitude of about 1240 miles.A year after the test, the debris field continues to spread, joining the cloud of general space junk, which includes everything from 10-ton rocket boosters to radioactive droplets of sodium potassium coolant from the nuclear cores of Soviet satellites. Source: Analysis courtesy of the Center for Space Standards and Innovation/Analytical Graphics, Inc. Data as of April 26, 2007. Objects greatly magnified for visibility. Litter Kings Sad to say, but some space junk -- such as spent boosters -- simply comes with the territory. Other flotsam results from indifference or lousy planning, such as the bags of garbage Soviet cosmonauts jettisoned from the MIR space station for 15 years. Here's how the three busiest space players stack up. United States: Topping the list, most U.S. space junk comes from the upper stages of sat launch vehicles. Russia: The relatively low ratio of debris to satellites will soon change: The explosion of a Russian rocket over Australia in February appears to have produced approximately 1200 pieces of fresh debris. China: Its January sat kill made it the top space polluter per satellite. ""Almost 85 percent of that debris will be in orbit in 100 years,"" says Kelso of the Center for Space Standards and Innovation. ""It shows how badly they messed things up with one event."

Hammer has released its year-end 2010 results for the credit industry penalty fees assessed during the past year. This is the fourth in the Hammer annual series of seven year-end reports, dealing with all aspects of credit card industry trends: risks, costs, and profits. Some of the report highlights are: Card penalty fees assessed during 2010 totaled $22.5 Billion in the latest Hammer model. This is down slightly from year-end 2009 of $22.9 Billion. Reasons for the decline include: fewer card accounts on the books due to recent portfolio purges, and delinquency figures improving through 2010. As you can see, other than 2010, penalty fees in the card business had been on an ever increasing annual climb: 2003: $10.7 B 2004: $11.7 B 2005: $14.8 B 2006: $17.1 B 2007: $18.1 B 2008: $19.0 B 2009: $22.9 B 2010: $22.5 B Company CEO Bob Hammer commented, “It is important to note that increased consumer costs due to raised APR’s for delinquent accounts (often termed “Penalty Pricing) are not included in the annual Hammer fee income model, as that interest charged is reported in the Interest Income category, not in “Non-Interest” (Fee) Income.” “Also, as in the past our fee income model broadly includes interchange income, penalty fees, annual fees, cash advance fees/bal. transfer fees, and enhancement income. Penalty fee income is comprised of late fees, over limit fees and other miscellaneous fee income, the vast majority (90%+) are late fees.” “Interest income for decades has clearly been the largest revenue stream for cards, followed by fee income. Those lines have now almost intersected, and are expected to do so in the next 18 – 24 months, with fee income then becoming the largest component of revenue for card issuers. Recent rule changes and regulation impacting interest cards may charge and how interest rate changes may be implemented have hastened issuers’ direction and refocus toward new fees and repricing current fees.” Hammer forecast for 2011: “Fee Income rising 9% for credit card companies.”- Formed in 1990, R.K. Hammer is an internationally known credit card industry advisor whose clients include some of the world’s largest financial institutions in the U.S. and in 50 countries abroad. Hammer branded research and reports have been used by issuers, processors, national associations, government agencies and regulators for over two decades.

The Washington Post, 9/26/04 Battling for Iraq  BYLINE: David H. Petraeus  SECTION: Editorial; B07  LENGTH: 1239 words  DATELINE: BAGHDAD Helping organize, train and equip nearly a quarter-million of Iraq's security forces is a daunting task. Doing so in the middle of a tough insurgency increases the challenge enormously, making the mission akin to repairing an aircraft while in flight -- and while being shot at. Now, however, 18 months after entering Iraq, I see tangible progress. Iraqi security elements are being rebuilt from the ground up. The institutions that oversee them are being reestablished from the top down. And Iraqi leaders are stepping forward, leading their country and their security forces courageously in the face of an enemy that has shown a willingness to do anything to disrupt the establishment of the new Iraq. In recent months, I have observed thousands of Iraqis in training and then watched as they have conducted numerous operations. Although there have been reverses -- not to mention horrific terrorist attacks -- there has been progress in the effort to enable Iraqis to shoulder more of the load for their own security, something they are keen to do. The future undoubtedly will be full of difficulties, especially in places such as Fallujah. We must expect setbacks and recognize that not every soldier or policeman we help train will be equal to the challenges ahead. Nonetheless, there are reasons for optimism. Today approximately 164,000 Iraqi police and soldiers (of which about 100,000 are trained and equipped) and an additional 74,000 facility protection forces are performing a wide variety of security missions. Equipment is being delivered. Training is on track and increasing in capacity. Infrastructure is being repaired. Command and control structures and institutions are being reestablished. Most important, Iraqi security forces are in the fight -- so much so that they are suffering substantial casualties as they take on more and more of the burdens to achieve security in their country. Since Jan. 1 more than 700 Iraqi security force members have been killed, and hundreds of Iraqis seeking to volunteer for the police and military have been killed as well. Six battalions of the Iraqi regular army and the Iraqi Intervention Force are now conducting operations. Two of these battalions, along with the Iraqi commando battalion, the counterterrorist force, two Iraqi National Guard battalions and thousands of policemen recently contributed to successful operations in Najaf. Their readiness to enter and clear the Imam Ali shrine was undoubtedly a key factor in enabling Grand Ayatollah Ali Sistani to persuade members of the Mahdi militia to lay down their arms and leave the shrine. In another highly successful operation several days ago, the Iraqi counterterrorist force conducted early-morning raids in Najaf that resulted in the capture of several senior lieutenants and 40 other members of that militia, and the seizure of enough weapons to fill nearly four 71/2-ton dump trucks. Within the next 60 days, six more regular army and six additional Intervention Force battalions will become operational. Nine more regular army battalions will complete training in January, in time to help with security missions during the Iraqi elections at the end of that month. Iraqi National Guard battalions have also been active in recent months. Some 40 of the 45 existing battalions -- generally all except those in the Fallujah-Ramadi area -- are conducting operations on a daily basis, most alongside coalition forces, but many independently. Progress has also been made in police training. In the past week alone, some 1,100 graduated from the basic policing course and five specialty courses. By early spring, nine academies in Iraq and one in Jordan will be graduating a total of 5,000 police each month from the eight-week course, which stresses patrolling and investigative skills, substantive and procedural legal knowledge, and proper use of force and weaponry, as well as pride in the profession and adherence to the police code of conduct. Iraq's borders are long, stretching more than 2,200 miles. Reducing the flow of extremists and their resources across the borders is critical to success in the counterinsurgency. As a result, with support from the Department of Homeland Security, specialized training for Iraq's border enforcement elements began earlier this month in Jordan. Regional academies in Iraq have begun training as well, and more will come online soon. In the months ahead, the 16,000-strong border force will expand to 24,000 and then 32,000. In addition, these forces will be provided with modern technology, including vehicle X-ray machines, explosive-detection devices and ground sensors. Outfitting hundreds of thousands of new Iraqi security forces is difficult and complex, and many of the units are not yet fully equipped. But equipment has begun flowing. Since July 1, for example, more than 39,000 weapons and 22 million rounds of ammunition have been delivered to Iraqi forces, in addition to 42,000 sets of body armor, 4,400 vehicles, 16,000 radios and more than 235,000 uniforms. Considerable progress is also being made in the reconstruction and refurbishing of infrastructure for Iraq's security forces. Some $1 billion in construction to support this effort has been completed or is underway, and five Iraqi bases are already occupied by entire infantry brigades. Numbers alone cannot convey the full story. The human dimension of this effort is crucial. The enemies of Iraq recognize how much is at stake as Iraq reestablishes its security forces. Insurgents and foreign fighters continue to mount barbaric attacks against police stations, recruiting centers and military installations, even though the vast majority of the population deplores such attacks. Yet despite the sensational attacks, there is no shortage of qualified recruits volunteering to join Iraqi security forces. In the past couple of months, more than 7,500 Iraqi men have signed up for the army and are preparing to report for basic training to fill out the final nine battalions of the Iraqi regular army. Some 3,500 new police recruits just reported for training in various locations. And two days after the recent bombing on a street outside a police recruiting location in Baghdad, hundreds of Iraqis were once again lined up inside the force protection walls at another location -- where they were greeted by interim Prime Minister Ayad Allawi. I meet with Iraqi security force leaders every day. Though some have given in to acts of intimidation, many are displaying courage and resilience in the face of repeated threats and attacks on them, their families and their comrades. I have seen their determination and their desire to assume the full burden of security tasks for Iraq. There will be more tough times, frustration and disappointment along the way. It is likely that insurgent attacks will escalate as Iraq's elections approach. Iraq's security forces are, however, developing steadily and they are in the fight. Momentum has gathered in recent months. With strong Iraqi leaders out front and with continued coalition -- and now NATO -- support, this trend will continue. It will not be easy, but few worthwhile things are. The writer, an Army lieutenant general, commands the Multinational Security Transition Command in Iraq. He previously commanded the 101st Airborne Division, which was deployed in Iraq from March 2003 until February 2004."

Donna Hanover shared a painful memory several years ago in an interview with The New York Times. On the night of his defeat, Mr. Giuliani crumpled at the foot of their bed and asked, ''Do they really think I'm mean?'' Looking toward a 1993 rematch, the candidate would find ways to become new and improved. He spent hundreds of hours in a self-designed seminar, inviting experts to tutor him on urban reforms. He also submitted to a political airbrushing by new strategists. Weight was lost, a tan was added. He danced a two-step at a hoedown in SoHo, greeting people with ''Howdy.'' At heart, however, Mr. Giuliani was still the scrappy prosecutor in a city where voters seemed willing to blame the incumbent for a staggering murder rate, homelessness and a general sense of disorder. He believed then -- as he does now -- ''that in New York, you have to be a fighter.'' He beat Mr. Dinkins by a margin of two percentage points, becoming the city's first Republican mayor in a generation. His campaign themes were true to his roots: part nostalgia, part law and order. He promised nothing less than to restore a better quality of life. His inaugural speech seemed the dare of a new sheriff, busting through the saloon doors. ''The era of fear has had a long-enough reign,'' he said. ''As of this moment, the expressions of cynicism -- New York is not governable, New York is not manageable, New York is not worth it -- all of these I declare politically incorrect.'' Mr. Giuliani considered himself a warrior in the free-for-all between cops and robbers. He was the people's choice for top cop, and, therefore, to oppose him was to rob the public of its collective will. In his third month as Mayor, the one-time political science major had occasion to describe his philosophy of government at a New York Post forum on crime. His passage from the liberal beliefs of his younger years was complete."

The Pentagon made the decision based on U.S. government assessments that people held in detention facilities are at high risk for the pandemic, said Maj. Diana R. Haynie, a spokeswoman for Joint Task Force Guantanamo Bay, which is in charge of holding the suspected terrorists. ""Detainees at JTF Guantanamo are considered to be at higher risk and therefore they will be offered the H1N1 vaccination,"" Haynie said. ""JTF Guantanamo conducts safe, humane, legal and transparent care and custody of detainees. As such, we must provide detainees the medical care necessary to maintain their health,"" she said. But Rep. Bart Stupak, D-Michigan, urged the Pentagon to reconsider. ""As long as Americans must wait to receive the vaccine, the detainees in Guantanamo Bay should not be given preferential treatment to receive the H1N1 vaccination,"" Stupak said in a letter to Secretary of the Army John McHugh. ""Until this shortage is addressed, I urge Pentagon officials to reconsider this decision to vaccinate terrorist detainees ahead of Americans who are waiting,"" Stupak said. Base officials had not received the vaccinations and did not know when they were expected to arrive, Haynie said. Once the vaccinations are received, doses will be administered to active-duty personnel before being offered to detainees and others on the base, Haynie said. The vaccination is mandatory for all uniformed personnel, she said. The vaccinations will be voluntary for the detainees, who will be briefed on the virus and the vaccine before they decide whether to receive the vaccine. Some of the detainees have already voluntarily taken the seasonal flu shot, Haynie said."

So last week, the Palin administration signed a contract with an Anchorage aircraft broker who thinks he can succeed where eBay couldn't The eBay thing didn't work out very well, said Dan Spencer, director of administrative services for the Department of Public Safety. He's the person charged with trying to get rid of the infamous Westwind II. The administration made a deal last week with Turbo North Aviation, promising the broker a 1.49 percent cut of the selling price. Former Gov. Frank Murkowski bought the jet, which cost the state about $2.6 million, over the protests of the Legislature and used it to fly around the state, sometimes mixing campaign errands with government business. After he defied almost everyone to acquire it, the jet became a political albatross for Murkowski. Gov. Sarah Palin beat Murkowski bad in last August's Republican primary. One of her campaign promises was to sell the plane and she's been trying to unload it for months. Robert Heckmann owns Turbo North Aviation. He said his company has sold more than 1,800 planes including two dozen or so jets in the past 27 years. Spencer said Heckmann suggested the asking price of $2,450,000, based on the current jet market. The state's definitely not going to give this plane away. If that was the case, then they would have sold it on eBay Heckmann said. He described prospective buyers a governments, corporate entities, oil companies, movie stars, well-to-do people. Meanwhile, the state is stuck making quarterly payments of about $62,000 on the Westwind II. So is the state sick of dealing with this bird? I don't know about anyone else Spencer said.

30,politifact3428,0,http://www.ssa.gov/history/nestor.html,Supreme Court Case: Flemming vs. Nestor,"Background to the Case:  The fact that workers contribute to the Social Security program's funding through a dedicated payroll tax establishes a unique connection between those tax payments and future benefits. More so than general federal income taxes can be said to establish ""rights"" to certain government services. This is often expressed in the idea that Social Security benefits are ""an earned right."" This is true enough in a moral and political sense. But like all federal entitlement programs, Congress can change the rules regarding eligibility--and it has done so many times over the years. The rules can be made more generous, or they can be made more restrictive. Benefits which are granted at one time can be withdrawn, as for example with student benefits, which were substantially scaled-back in the 1983 Amendments.  There has been a temptation throughout the program's history for some people to suppose that their FICA payroll taxes entitle them to a benefit in a legal, contractual sense. That is to say, if a person makes FICA contributions over a number of years, Congress cannot, according to this reasoning, change the rules in such a way that deprives a contributor of a promised future benefit. Under this reasoning, benefits under Social Security could probably only be increased, never decreased, if the Act could be amended at all. Congress clearly had no such limitation in mind when crafting the law. Section 1104 of the 1935 Act, entitled ""RESERVATION OF POWER,"" specifically said: ""The right to alter, amend, or repeal any provision of this Act is hereby reserved to the Congress."" Even so, some have thought that this reservation was in some way unconstitutional. This is the issue finally settled by Flemming v. Nestor.  In this 1960 Supreme Court decision Nestor's denial of benefits was upheld even though he had contributed to the program for 19 years and was already receiving benefits. Under a 1954 law, Social Security benefits were denied to persons deported for, among other things, having been a member of the Communist party. Accordingly, Mr. Nestor's benefits were terminated. He appealed the termination arguing, among other claims, that promised Social Security benefits were a contract and that Congress could not renege on that contract. In its ruling, the Court rejected this argument and established the principle that entitlement to Social Security benefits is not contractual right."

I believe strongly that they should. And so do the 500 mayors who are members of our bi-partisan coalition of Mayor Against Illegal Guns. It is time to close the ""Terror Gap"" in our gun laws. This morning I will be testifying at a hearing of the Senate Homeland Security Committee about the easy access that terror suspects have to guns and explosives. I wanted to share with lawmakers the hard-earned perspective New Yorkers have on this national security risk. The car bomb the New York City Police Department found in Times Square on Saturday night was not the only attempted terrorist attack on our city since 9/11 -- far from it. And sadly, it won't be the last. Since 1990, there have been more than 20 terrorists plots -- or actual attacks -- against our city. In the last year alone, the NYPD -- working closely with federal authorities -- prevented two major planned attacks on our City. The first was last May, when the terrorists purchased guns and explosives as part of a planned attack on a Temple and Jewish Center in the Bronx. The second was in September, when the City and federal authorities broke up a plot to detonate explosives in the New York City subway system. And, of course, attacks and planned attacks have not been limited to New York. Last June in Little Rock, Arkansas, a man opened fire at a military recruiting station, killing one private and wounding another. At the time of the shooting, the FBI was already investigating the man after his arrest in Yemen with a fake Somali passport. He was charged with murder and 16 counts of terrorist acts. And on November 5, 2009, Major Nidal Hasan shot 43 people at Fort Hood -- killing 13. We know Hasan was able to buy a handgun despite having been under investigation by the FBI for links to terrorism. The Bush Administration first proposed closing the Terror Gap in 2007. But because Congress has failed to act on that proposal, people who may want to do our country harm have been able to buy guns and explosives. Today, the Government Accountability Office has released new data showing that suspects on the terrorism watch lists were able to buy guns and explosives from licensed US dealers 1,119 times between 2004 and 2010. That is a serious and dangerous breach of national security. That's why the more than 500 mayors in Mayors Against Illegal Guns, a coalition that I co-chair with Mayor Tom Menino of Boston, support legislation to close the Terror Gap. This issue is a centerpiece of the coalition's fight to strengthen the federal background check system. Today, we have launched a new website -- www.TerrorGap.org -- to help educate Congress and the public about the Terror Gap and its consequences. This legislation would give FBI agents the authority to block terror suspects from buying guns and explosives. It would also give them the ability to make exceptions when they determine that blocking a sale might tip off a suspect who is under investigation. And the bill also allows those on the list to appeal their status to the Justice Department -- and challenge the determination in court. Attorney General Eric Holder supported closing the Terror Gap in testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee last year. And so does the vast majority of Americans. A December poll by Republican pollster Frank Luntz found that 82% of NRA members, and 86% of other gun owners, support closing the Terror Gap. To learn more and take action, please visit: www.TerrorGap.org. In New York City, we are doing everything humanly possible to prevent another terrorist attack. Under Commissioner Kelly's leadership, the NYPD has developed one of the world's most advanced counter-terrorism programs. One thousand of our best officers work on counter-terrorism and intelligence efforts every day. A key element of any smart counter-terrorism strategy is to make it harder for terrorists to strike. That's why air passengers walk through metal detectors. That's why our police officers randomly check bags in the subway. That's why our police officers patrol sensitive locations. And that's why it's just common sense to give the FBI the authority to keep terror suspects from buying guns and explosives. Now, finally, it's time for Congress to act and fix the Terror Gap.

Usually 1% of the population contribute 50% of income tax revenue, but the capital gains of these rich individuals have evaporated. Dismal relations between Democrats and Republicans have all but frozen business in the state capital, Sacramento. A two-thirds majority is required to pass any budget, but Republicans, with just over a third of the legislature, are refusing to countenance tax rises while the Democrats are balking at spending cuts. Schwarzenegger has proposed deep cuts to social programmes, including aid for the elderly, disabled and impoverished, plus cuts to schools, healthcare and universities. Larry Gerston, a professor of political science at San José State University, says this will accentuate an already yawning gap between the rich and poor: ""The state is quickly becoming an hourglass economy. The middle class is all but evaporating – people are either moving further to the top or sinking to the bottom."" The initial victims of the standoff are California's creditors, who had received 91,000 IOUs worth $354m as of the end of Thursday. High-street banks, including Bank of America, Wells Fargo and JP Morgan Chase, agreed to cash them for a few days but announced that they would not accept them beyond the end of the week. ""There's a sentiment inside the banks that the longer they accept the warrants, the longer the budget impasse will go on,"" said Beth Mills, a spokeswoman for the Californian Bankers Association. That leaves IOU holders with limited options. Certain local credit unions are still taking the notes at face value. Beyond that, holders face a choice of either waiting until October to receive their money or selling them at a discount on a rapidly developing informal market. Many online offers for the IOUs propose dubious rates. On eBay, one buyer was willing to pay $140 in return for $170 worth of IOUs. Granger, whose firm sees the debt crisis as a potentially lucrative opportunity, said a market rate was emerging of between 80 and 95 cents on the dollar. ""Because they're cumbersome and troublesome to deal with, a lot of the big investment houses are not going to deal with them,"" he said. ""And some people will just put them in their piggy banks."" Last week, the credit agency Fitch cut its rating on California's debt by two notches from ""A minus"" to BBB - just two levels above ""junk"" status. Analysts fear that there could be weeks of IOUs to come. Gerston says a confrontational culture of extreme left-wing and right-wing politics has contributed to the morass, as has a reluctance to wake up to problems: ""Californians are known as laidback for a reason they've earned that reputation. Most people just don't believe what's in front of them. They just don't buy it."""
34,politifact9691,0,http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/first-read/impeachment-talk-becomes-cynical-game-n168436,Impeachment Talk Becomes a Cynical Game,"On Friday, a top White House aide said it was possible Republicans could impeach President Obama if he decided to take executive action on immigration. Days later, on Tuesday, House Speaker John Boehner fired back at this impeachment chatter: “Listen, it’s all a scam started by Democrats at the White House.” But let’s be honest here: Both sides -- Democrats and Republicans -- believe the impeachment talk is good for motivating their base. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee says it’s raked in more than $3 million in online donations since Thursday with solicitations like this one from House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (“Boehner is planning a vote to sue the president. The House of Representatives has never sued a sitting President in all of U.S. history. And if they do it, impeachment may very well be the next step”). Democrats also hope the impeachment talk can force a replay of 1998, when the impeachment proceedings against Bill Clinton backfired against the GOP that midterm season. As for Boehner and House Republicans, they’re being disingenuous, too. The GOP base loves the impeachment talk (see Sarah Palin, Allen West, Drudge, and the rhetoric from some sitting House members). Indeed, Boehner’s lawsuit seems intended to tap into that conservative impeachment enthusiasm -- but without going all the way to impeachment. It’s impeachment-lite. The House will vote tonight on that lawsuit against the president, per NBC’s Frank Thorp. And it’s beneath the White House and the speaker So both sides are playing this cynical game, turning the midterms into a base election that will be decided by who best motivates their base rather than by trying to fix the country’s problems. (Republicans: “This President is breaking the law!” Democrats: “They want to impeach the president!”) And what’s particularly jarring is that this isn’t taking place on the campaign trail -- but rather from their official capacities at the White House and on Capitol Hill. It’s beneath the White House, and it’s beneath the speaker. And each side can rationalize their actions all they want, but all its doing is reinforcing the decision by MILLIONS of Americans who have chosen not to participate in the political process this year that they made the right decision. The leaders in both parties aren’t taking their frustrations seriously. Instead, leaders in Washington are falling back on base turnout gimmicks. A Tale of Two Bills Despite that cynical game of impeachment talk, here is a GOOD story to tell about Washington from earlier in the week: Democrats and Republicans came together to strike a deal on reforming American’s embattled VA hospital system. And what happened was an ACTUAL compromise -- where both sides gave up something to get something. Democrats got increased funding for VA hospitals; Republicans got additional flexibility for veterans to get private care. So that’s on track to become law before Congress departs on its August recess. And a big reason why is that Democrats and Republicans couldn’t afford to look like they were alienating a key constituency -- veterans. And that’s maybe the biggest difference between VA reform (which looks like it will become law) and the emergency relief at the border (which doesn’t). In the case of the border, there just isn’t a major constituency that puts fear into BOTH parties. House GOP “cautiously optimistic” about ability to get 218 votes for border bill As for the House GOP’s $659 million border bill, NBC’s Frank Thorp reports that House GOP aides are “cautiously optimistic that the border supplemental can pass with Republican votes, and expect a handful of moderate Democrats to support the measure as well. Leadership is still in the process of whipping the bill, going from member to member during votes trying to quell any concerns they may have. But it was clear that leadership was trying to nip conservative's concerns in the bud Tuesday when Boehner released a statement unequivocally stating that if the Senate tried to add the Gang of Eight comprehensive immigration reform bill to the supplemental, it would hit a ‘brick wall’ in the House.” Then again, it’s truly remarkable that the House GOP leadership has to fight tooth and nail for a bill that has ZERO chance of becoming reality. To expend political capital internally to make a point, welcome to Washington, circa 2014. Latest on the Highway Trust Fund standoff Meanwhile, here’s the latest on the Highway Trust Fund legislation: “The Senate Tuesday approved a short-term patch to keep funds flowing to highway projects through Dec. 19, but Speaker John A. Boehner has already promised to strip the Senate provisions and send the House-passed bill right back,” Roll Call reports. “After the Senate’s version of the bill passed 79 to 18 — Finance Committee ranking member Orrin Hatch, R-Utah called it a ‘free vote…because the House is going to send this right back, they are going to strip everything out — after they’ve left’ for the August recess.” So just when it looked like Congress would AVOID a highway trust fund “cliff” of sorts, the threat is back. And this is Senate vs. House stuff -- not necessarily, GOP vs Dem business. Economy grew by 4% in 2nd quarter More good economic news: “After a dismal winter, the U.S. economy sprang back to life in the April-June quarter, growing at a fast 4 percent annual rate on the strength of higher consumer and business spending,” the AP says. “The Commerce Department says the second-quarter rebound followed a sharp 2.1 percent annualized drop in economic activity in the January-March quarter. That figure was revised up from a previous estimate of a 2.9 percent decline.” Tom Steyer’s TV campaign begins -- against Joni Ernst in Iowa The millions of dollars in TV ads that liberal environmentalist Tom Steyer plans to spend in the midterms is beginning -- with the release of NextGen Climate’s multi-million-dollar campaign in Iowa against GOP Senate nominee Joni Ernst. This new TV ad charges that Ernst is tied to Republican special interests. NextGen Climate says this is the first of a series in ads hitting Ernst, and it’s a $2.6 million buy over five weeks in Des Moines, Cedar Rapids, and the Quad Cities markets. A little background on Steyer’s involvement this midterm cycle: A Super PAC funded by Democratic environmentalist billionaire Tom Steyer has announced it will spend as much as $100 million this election season attacking Republicans in seven key states who it says are climate-science ‘deniers,’ elevating the issue of climate change in these contests. Steyer’s group, NextGen Climate, says it will target Govs. Rick Scott of Florida, Paul LePage of Maine and Tom Corbett of Pennsylvania, as well as GOP Senate candidates Cory Gardner in Colorado, Joni Ernst in Iowa, Terri Lynn Land in Michigan and Scott Brown in New Hampshire. Poll: Kasich still leading in Ohio A new Quinnipiac poll finds Ohio Gov. John Kasich (R) leading Democratic challenger Ed Fitzgerald by 12 points among registered voters in Ohio’s gubernatorial race, 48%-36%. Of all the 2010 GOP victors, it’s mildly surprising that Kasich now among safer of these incumbents sitting in a swing state. He’s still not out of the woods, but he’s stronger today than any strategist in either party would have thought two years ago. Dueling coal ads in West Virginia Days after Natalie Tennant (D) released a new TV ad in West Virginia’s Senate race hitting her party’s own president on coal, Republican opponent Shelley Moore Capito is out with her own TV ad on coal -- and trying to one up Tennant. Capito responded immediately, and doesn’t seem to be taking any chances here The bombshell in the Bob McDonnell trial If you followed former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell’s rise and fall -- like we have over the past five years -- this was a stunning story. And talk about a twist: “Lawyers for former Virginia first lady Maureen McDonnell say her marriage had broken down by the time a former CEO began to lavish gifts on her -- and he became her ‘favorite playmate.’ The bombshell was revealed Tuesday during opening statements in a corruption trial against Maureen and her husband, former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell,” NBC Washington’s Julie Carey reported. More: “The couple arrived separately at federal court over the past two days, a sharp contrast to the united front they showed when they were indicted 10 days after he left office in January. Before the trial, they often held hands in the courthouse. Maureen's defense attorney, Bill Burck, said during opening statements Tuesday that not only was the couple's marriage a wreck, but that Maureen developed feelings for Williams as he took her on a designer clothes shopping trip and showered her with attention. ‘You'd even hear she had a crush on on him. Unfortunately, unlike the other man in her life, Jonnie Williams paid attention to her,’ Burck said.” Here’s what’s particularly stunning: The defense is trying to PROVE a romantic relationship; usually, it’s the other way around."
35,politifact6473,0,http://cbo.gov/publication/43471,"Letter to the Honorable John Boehner providing an estimate for H.R. 6079, the Repeal of Obamacare Act","CBO and the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) have estimated the direct spending and revenue effects of H.R. 6079, the Repeal of Obamacare Act, as passed by the House of Representatives on July 11, 2012. H.R. 6079 would repeal the Affordable Care Act (ACA), with the exception of one subsection that has no budgetary effect. This estimate reflects the spending and revenue projections in CBO’s March 2012 baseline as adjusted to take into account the effects of the recent Supreme Court decision regarding the ACA. For various reasons discussed in the report, the estimated budgetary effects of repealing the ACA by enacting H.R. 6079 are close to, but not equivalent to, an estimate of the budgetary effects of the ACA with the signs reversed. What Is the Impact of Repealing the ACA on the Federal Budget? Assuming that H.R. 6079 is enacted near the beginning of fiscal year 2013, CBO and JCT estimate that, on balance, the direct spending and revenue effects of enacting that legislation would cause a net increase in federal budget deficits of $109 billion over the 2013–2022 period. Specifically, we estimate that H.R. 6079 would reduce direct spending by $890 billion and reduce revenues by $1 trillion between 2013 and 2022, thus adding $109 billion to federal budget deficits over that period. What Major Components Result in the Net Increase in Deficits? Deficits would be increased under H.R. 6079 because the net savings from eliminating the insurance coverage provisions would be more than offset by the combination of other spending increases and revenue reductions: The ACA contains a set of provisions designed to expand health insurance coverage, which, on net, are projected to cost the government money. The costs of those coverage expansions—which include the cost of the subsidies to be provided through the exchanges, increased outlays for Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), and tax credits for certain small employers—will be partially offset by penalty payments from employers and uninsured individuals, revenues from the excise tax on high-premium insurance plans, and net savings from other coverage-related effects. By repealing those coverage provisions of the ACA, over the 2013–2022 period, H.R. 6079 would yield gross savings of an estimated $1,677 billion and net savings (after accounting for the offsets just mentioned) of $1,171 billion. The ACA also includes a number of other provisions related to health care that are estimated to reduce net federal outlays (primarily for Medicare). By repealing those provisions, H.R. 6079 would increase other direct spending in the next decade by an estimated $711 billion. The ACA includes a number of provisions that are estimated to increase federal revenues (apart from the effect of provisions related to insurance coverage), mostly by increasing the Hospital Insurance (HI) payroll tax and extending it to net investment income for high- income taxpayers, and imposing fees or excise taxes on certain manufacturers and insurers. Repealing those provisions would reduce revenues by an estimated $569 billion over the 2013–2022 period. What Would be the Effect of Repealing the ACA on Discretionary Spending? In addition to those effects on direct spending and revenues, by CBO’s estimates, repeal of the ACA would reduce the need for appropriations to the Internal Revenue Service by between $5 billion and $10 billion over 10 years. Repealing the ACA would also reduce the need for appropriations to the Department of Health and Human Services by between $5 billion and $10 billion over 10 years, CBO estimates. Such savings might be reflected in reductions in total discretionary spending, or they might free up room for additional spending for other purposes under the caps on discretionary appropriations that were established by the Budget Control Act of 2011. H.R. 6079 would also repeal a number of authorizations for appropriations, which, if left in place, might or might not result in additional appropriations. Why Are These Estimates Uncertain? Projections of the budgetary impact of H.R. 6079 are quite uncertain because they are based, in large part, on projections of the effects of the ACA, which are themselves highly uncertain. Assessing the effects of making broad changes in the nation’s health care and health insurance systems requires estimates of a broad array of technical, behavioral, and economic factors. Separating the incremental effects of the provisions in the ACA that affect spending for ongoing programs and revenue streams becomes more uncertain as the time since enactment grows. The recent Supreme Court decision that essentially made the expansion of the Medicaid program a state option has also increased the uncertainty of the estimates. However, CBO and JCT, in consultation with outside experts, have devoted a great deal of care and effort to the analysis of health care legislation in the past few years, and the agencies have strived to develop estimates that are in the middle of the distribution of possible outcomes."

The Real Fight Will Be for Crimea | Opinion,"Amid the numerous reports of events in Ukraine in recent days, observers have largely overlooked the situation in Crimea. But I am convinced that the Black Sea peninsula could become the center of major events in the near future. As a result of the confusion, Russia gave Crimea to Ukraine but retained Sevastopol.  Demonstrators in Crimea have been toting signs reading ""Putin is our president"" and ""Russia, we have been abandoned, take us back!"" Late Sunday in the city of Kerch, someone took down the Ukrainian flag above the city administration building and hoisted the Russian flag in its place. At the same time, armored vehicles from the Russian military base in Sevastopol blocked all entrances to the city — essentially protecting it — after local authorities refused to recognize the new Ukrainian government. What's more, a throng of 20,000 demonstrators spontaneously appointed a local businessman and Russian national to head the city. He immediately announced his refusal to transfer local tax revenues to Kiev and claimed personal authority over the city's police force. Now that President Vladimir Putin is no longer tied up with the Olympics, I have no doubt he will use the ""interests of Russians"" in Crimea as a pretext for supporting the separatist movement there, just as he did with South Ossetia in 2008. Putin does not even need to send troops to Crimea; they are already there, in accordance with a bilateral agreement with Ukraine. Former Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko had planned to cancel that agreement, but his successor, recently impeached President Viktor Yanukovych, extended it. I was actually born in Sevastopol. Interestingly, my birth certificate lists my birthplace as ""Sevastopol"" but makes no mention of ""Ukrainian SSR,"" even though Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev gave Crimea to Ukraine four years before my birth. Crimea was part of Russia until 1954, at which point Khrushchev presented the region to Ukraine to commemorate the 300th anniversary of the historical decision by the Pereyaslavska Rada, the precursor to the Ukrainian parliament, to unify the country with Russia. However, Khrushchev's spontaneous gesture was implemented somewhat sloppily, and the Sevastopol legislature never officially acknowledged it. Khrushchev had forgotten that in 1948, Stalin issued a decree removing Sevastopol from the jurisdiction of the Crimean administration and making it an autonomous entity under Moscow's direct control. As a result of this confusion, Russia gave Crimea to Ukraine but retained Sevastopol. Surprisingly, that arrangement did not bother anybody for several decades. Nobody could have imagined that the Soviet Union would one day split into separate republics and that the borders between them would have to be redefined. For the most part, the residents of Sevastopol were seamen, their families or support staff. The city was a large naval base, and it remains one to this day. The majority of residents are Russian who receive their salaries in rubles even though, administratively, the city is Ukrainian. This has proved a constant source of tension and a source of endless debate between Ukrainian and Russian nationalists. In recent years, the city has been managed by two separate administrations — the city administration appointed by Kiev, and representatives of Russia's Black Sea Fleet, a massive organization that owns almost everything in Sevastopol, right down to the kindergartens. My father was in the military, and he moved our family from Sevastopol to the Moscow region while I was still an infant. I cannot rightfully call the city my hometown, although we did visit it a few times when I was a schoolboy. During those visits to Sevastopol, I never once saw a sign written in Ukrainian and never heard anyone speaking Ukrainian in the streets. Of course, that was a very long time ago. The Soviet Constitution first mentioned Sevastopol as part of Ukraine in 1978, and that moment began the city's gradual but ultimately unsuccessful assimilation into Ukraine. Many people considered it extremely unfair that the Belavezha Accords, signed after the collapse of the Soviet Union, formally included Sevastopol as part of Ukraine. However, the presidents who signed those accords came to power through legitimate elections and their respective parliaments ratified the agreements. I don't know why President Boris Yeltsin did not raise the question of Sevastopol, or the Crimea in general, with Ukraine in 1991. I once read the memoirs of a member of the Ukrainian delegation to the accords. He wrote that the Ukrainian side was certain Yeltsin would insist that Russia regain Crimea following the Soviet collapse and it was very surprised when he never made such a demand. The only way Russia can alter the current situation now is to start a war in Crimea. Many observers believe that, despite Putin's blustery statements, he has no real desire to fight with anyone. His goal in supporting separatists is not to annex additional territory to this already vast and difficult-to-manage country, but to ensure that any republic breaking away from the Soviet empire becomes burdened with internal unrest and conflict. This would explain Moscow's actions in the self-proclaimed Transdnestr republic, South Ossetia and Abkhazia, and it is why Putin might seek to foster instability in Crimea. There is little doubt that Putin will aggressively play the Crimean card now and that Moscow will encourage and provide ample funding to all Ukrainian separatist movements. Crimea has always been a source of anxiety for Kiev, and it is unclear just how far Putin will go this time in his efforts to intensify those difficulties."

Barack Obama, D-Ill., looks on as he walks along his tour of the National Gypsum plant Sunday, Feb. 24, 2008, in Lorain, Ohio. (AP Photo/Rick Bowmer) Obama Hits Clinton on NAFTA Support LORAIN, Ohio (AP) — Barack Obama accused Democratic presidential rival Hillary Rodham Clinton on Sunday of trying to walk away from a long record of support for NAFTA, the free trade agreement that he said has cost 50,000 jobs in Ohio, site of next week's primary. At the same time, he said attempts to repeal the trade deal ""would probably result in more job losses than job gains in the United States."" One day after Clinton angrily accused him of distorting her record on the North American Free Trade Agreement in mass mailings, the Illinois senator was eager to rekindle the long-distance debate, using passages from the former first lady's book as well as her own words. ""Ten years after NAFTA passed, Senator Clinton said it was good for America,"" Obama said. ""Well, I don't think NAFTA has been good for America — and I never have."" ""The fact is, she was saying great things about NAFTA until she started running for president,"" Obama told an audience at a factory that makes wall board, located in a working class community west of Cleveland. ""A couple years after it passed, she said NAFTA was a 'free and fair trade agreement' and that it was 'proving its worth.' And in 2004, she said, ""I think, on balance, NAFTA has been good for New York and America,"" he said. The trade agreement has long been unpopular in the industrial Midwest, where critics blame it for lost jobs and shuttered factories, many of which once employed union workers who tend to vote Democratic. Ohio and Texas both hold primaries next week, with 334 delegates combined, and former President Clinton has said publicly his wife probably needs to win both of them if she is to win the Democratic presidential nomination. Vermont and Rhode Island also hold primaries on March 4, but have far fewer delegates and have not attracted nearly as much attention. On another issue, Obama said he was not concerned that Republicans might attempt to depict him as unpatriotic if he becomes the Democratic nominee. Asked about a series of events, such as not placing his hand over his heart during the national anthem, he said, ""The way I will respond to it is with the truth. That I owe everything I am to this country."" He also said patriotism had more than one definition, and that Republicans had presided over a war ""in which our troops did not get the body armor they needed"" or were sent into the war zone without enough training. Polls show Clinton with a narrowing lead in Ohio, where trade has long been a sensitive issue. Given that backdrop, the issue is the core of Obama's drive to win the Ohio primary and possibly force Clinton from the race. At the news conference, he noted that she had said Saturday that the agreement was negotiated by President George H.W. Bush, and passed and signed into law while her husband was in the White House. He said Clinton has ""essentially presented herself as co-president during the Clinton years. Every good thing that happened she says she was a part of and so the notion that you can selectively pick what you take credit for and then run away from what isnt politically convenient, that doesnt make sense."" On Saturday, Clinton called attention to her plan to fix problems with NAFTA and a commitment against any future trade deals ""unless they are positive for American workers."" To an audience of Boilermakers Union members and their families, Obama promised the same thing, with particular attention paid to labor and environmental concerns. ""Now, if we're honest with ourselves, we'll acknowledge that we can't stop globalization in its tracks and that some of these jobs aren't coming back,"" he said. ""But what I refuse to accept is that we have to stand idly by while workers watch their jobs get shipped overseas."""
38,politifact546,0,https://web.archive.org/web/20080619025707/http://www.tampabay.com:80/news/politics/elections/article628630.ece,"In reversal, McCain says lift ban on offshore drilling","WASHINGTON — In a break with his past policy and his allies in the environmental movement, Republican presidential candidate John McCain on Monday called for ending the federal ban on offshore oil and natural gas exploration so coastal states could decide whether to permit drilling. And as an incentive to boost domestic energy production, states that do approve exploration off their shores should be paid ""tangible financial benefits,"" McCain said. ""I think that this … would be very helpful in the short term in resolving our energy crisis,"" he told reporters at his Arlington, Va., campaign headquarters. He plans to expound on his plan today in Houston. ""We've (seen the rising costs of energy) in the form of food prices, in the form of gasoline, in the form of threats of inflation. … And we must — we must — embark on a national mission to eliminate our dependence on foreign oil and reduce greenhouse gases through the development of alternate energy sources,"" he said. ""And, as I said, exploration is a step toward the longer-term goal."" Gov. Charlie Crist, a close ally of McCain's who has long opposed drilling off Florida's coasts, said he loved the idea of giving states control, and he didn't rule out allowing exploration off Florida. ""It's the last thing in the world I'd like to do, but I also understand what people are paying at the pump, and I understand the drag it is on our economy,"" Crist told the St. Petersburg Times Monday night. ""Something has to be done in a responsible, pragmatic way."" McCain has supported the moratorium on offshore drilling in the past and has touted his position during campaign stops in Florida. The Arizona senator also opposes drilling in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. But with the price of gasoline topping $4 per gallon, the pressure on him and other politicians to act is enormous, though there is little any of them can do to ease prices in the near term. Environmentalists worry that state legislatures would be unduly influenced by the promise of cash and heavy lobbying by well-financed business groups, such as the Associated Industries of Florida, which supports drilling off Florida. ""It would be hard for state legislatures in Florida and anywhere else to resist a big pot of money being dangled in front of their nose, especially states that are facing big budget shortfalls,"" said Holly Binns, field director of Environment Florida. In calling for states to decide, McCain has laid out a politically cautious position: He moved closer to conservative leaders and his Republican colleagues on Capitol Hill, who have been demanding more offshore drilling. Just last week, Democrats on a House subcommittee narrowly defeated a Republican attempt to overturn the 26-year-old moratorium. Yet by giving states the final say, McCain also is less likely to alienate voters in Florida and other coastal states who fear drilling will bring pollution. Asked how far offshore states should be able to control, McCain said: ""I think that's a subject of negotiation and discussion. But right now, as you know, there's a moratorium, and those … moratoria have to be lifted. And they have to be lifted so that states can make those decisions."" Crist said the idea was ""brilliant"" because ""it leaves it up to the states to decide what's best for themselves."" As for whether he could see Florida allowing drilling under McCain's plan, Crist said it depends on ""how far (from shore), how safe, how protective of our environment it would be — there are many contingencies that would have to go into it."" Since 1982, a congressional moratorium renewed each year has closed most of the U.S. coastline to drilling, with the exception of waters off Alaska and in the western and central Gulf of Mexico. A presidential moratorium enacted by the first President George Bush in 1990 also prohibits drilling. The federal Minerals Management Service estimates that 86-billion barrels of oil and 420-trillion cubic feet of natural gas lie in undiscovered reserves off the U.S. coast, though the agency could not say how much of it is now off-limits. Considering the United States uses about 20-million barrels of oil each day — 60 percent of it imported — that is about 11 years worth of oil, and Republicans in Congress have been clamoring lately to tap it. But there's no guarantee most of that oil is even accessible, and finding and drilling those reserves would take years, experts say. In late 2006, McCain supported a congressional compromise for the eastern Gulf of Mexico that bars drilling within about 230 miles of Tampa Bay through 2022, while opening 8.3-million acres to drilling. The government estimates the area contains 1.26-billion barrels of oil and 5.8-trillion cubic feet of natural gas. Production there has not yet begun. Several East Coast states, especially Virginia, have expressed interest in allowing drilling off their shores in return for a share of the money that oil companies pay the federal government for drilling rights. A spokesman for McCain's Democratic opponent, Sen. Barack Obama of Illinois, said Obama opposes McCain's idea and instead would make ""significant investments in alternative forms of energy."" Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., a leading opponent of offshore drilling, called the idea ""irresponsible."" ""There isn't enough oil in the U.S. to make even the smallest dent in world oil prices,"" said Nelson, who on Monday introduced a bill to ban unregulated speculative trading of oil, which some experts blame for the sharp price increases. ""To curb prices in the short run, we need to regulate oil traders. For the long term, we need to break America's oil addiction,"" he said.

If not we would have had better public transportation and access, but that would not be a profit. by Jack Jun 17, 2008 9:17 AM Evidently, those who are against drilling don't understand the influence commodity speculators have in the current cost of a barrel of oil. If Bush were to issue an Executive Order today to drill in ANWR, the price would drop $30-$4o overnight. by Jack Jun 17, 2008 9:16 AM It would take at least 2 - 4 years before any new wells began producing, and even so, there's no guarantee that oil would not be sold in the USA. Right now a lot USA made biodiesel is sold in Europe, not kept here. People need to ask better questions by Scott Jun 17, 2008 9:13 AM The price of oil is not being driven by supply issues. The Saudis confirmed that a couple weeks ago. Big oil is using their profits to bid up the price of oil. Regulate the futures market and watch the price of oil plummet.

When he announced his 9th czar, Obama already had more than any other President. We gave him a break and didn't include the special envoys - like George Mitchell to the Middle East - considered czars by some. Despite that, there are still upwards of 20 (and more to come, for cyber security and intellectual property). John McCain's words ring true: Obama has more czars than the Romanovs. Drug Czar Czar R. Gil Kerlikowske  What it means:  The former police chief of Seattle, Kerlikowske was sworn in as the the Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy on May 7.

Energy Czar Czar Carol Browner  What it means:  Officially the Assistant to the President for Energy and Climate Change, this is what Obama said at the press conference announcing her nomination: ""Carol understands that our efforts to create jobs, achieve energy security and combat climate change demand integration among different agencies, cooperation between federal, state and local governments and partnership with the private sector."" Auto Recovery Czar Czar Ed Montgomery  What it means:  Montgomery is the director of recovery for auto communities and workers - he's spent time in Detroit at workshops ""on applying for federal grants and other financial assistance."" The title can possibly be shared with Steve Rattner, who the NYT calls the ""car czar lite"" - ""one of 14 people on a committee that is orchestrating the rescue of the giant automakers.""

Great Lakes Czar Czar Cameron Davis  What it means:  Appointed by Obama to oversee the cleanup of the Great Lakes. Intelligence Czar Czar Dennis Blair  What it means:  Charged with filling the seats on Obama's National Intelligence Council and coordinating among agencies.

Economic Czar Czar Paul Volcker  What it means:  Often referred to as Obama's ""big-picture"" economic czar, Volcker is charged with coordinating with the Treasury Department and other relevant agencies. Regulatory Czar Czar Cass Sunstein  What it means:  The White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs ""oversees regulations throughout the government, from the Environmental Protection Agency to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration...the job will be crucial as the new administration overhauls financial-services regulations, attempts to pass universal health care and tries to forge a new approach to controlling emissions of greenhouse gases."" Bailout Czar (or TARP Czar) Czar Herb Allison  What it means:  This former Fannie Mae CEO is overseeing the Troubled Assets Relief Program, the $700 billion bank bailout that happened under Bush. Stimulus Accountability Czar Czar Earl Devaney  What it means:  Devaney oversees the $787 billion stimulus package passed earlier this year (""the kind of guy you'd want guarding your cash,"" Devaney is a former Secret Service agent who investigated Jack Abramoff). Border Czar Czar Alan Bersin  What it means:  Bersin, who had a similar position under the Clinton Administration, is working with Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano to curb the violence and trafficking of drugs along the U.S.-Mexico border. Non-Proliferation Czar Czar Gary Samore  What it means:  Samore, also known as the WMD Czar, is Obama's point man for ensuring the proliferation of such weapons doesn't occur.

40,politifact1251,0,https://web.archive.org/web/20090924105940/http://www.rollcall.com:80/features/Health-Care_Policy-Briefing/health_care/38655-1.html,Rockefeller: An Opportunity We Cant Pass Up,"Earlier this month, the president outlined a clear vision for health care reform  a plan that will put families ahead of corporate profits, reduce skyrocketing health care costs and provide a strong pathway for more Americans to access meaningful and affordable care. With Congress back in session and back to work on health care reform, we must continue to build on the presidents vision and capitalize on this profound opportunity to fix a broken system and make life better for millions of Americans. Today, it is an undeniable fact that millions of families carry the burden of failed health care policies and unmet promises. Too many feel as if they are walking a tightrope  just one serious illness threatens to throw them off balance and send them tumbling down. Real protection for the American people means health coverage must be accountable  the insurance that you buy today must be there when you need it tomorrow. Too many families who have paid their premiums faithfully every month for years expecting to be covered suddenly find themselves stuck with devastatingly high bills when they get sick; their plans dont actually provide coverage when they need it. It makes you wonder what the purpose of that health insurance is in the first place, if it offers no protection against the ruin that they hoped to avoid. As chairman of the Senate Finance Subcommittee on Health Care, I believe we must continue to make tougher insurance regulation and greater transparency a top priority, and I will fight to protect families and businesses across the nation. The Finance Committee has laid out its framework, but at this point it simply does not go far enough to protect Americans from devastating insurance practices or outright loss of coverage. Many Americans  46 percent  get their health coverage through large employers in the self-insured market. Any new insurance market reforms, such as a prohibition on rescissions and benefit caps, should apply to this market as well. Otherwise, we will be doing very little to improve the coverage of a significant number of Americans. In West Virginia, the example of a local garment company, Corbin Limited, is a sad reminder of the self-insured markets risks. When Corbin declared bankruptcy in April 2003, 444 former employees were left with $2 million in medical bills. With a self-funded plan, Corbin was subject only to the Department of Labors inadequate regulation and had no licensing requirements or solvency standards. When the company went under, its employees had no means of appeal. Comprehensive health insurance reforms like prohibiting rescissions, eliminating pre-existing condition exclusions and protecting employees in case of bankruptcy must apply to all insurers and policies in every single market  including the self-insured. In the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, we recently heard testimony by Wendell Potter, who worked in the insurance industry for more than 20 years. He explained very clearly the tactics insurance companies use to keep policyholders in the dark. He said they deceive consumers with incomprehensible explanations of their benefits, often leading people to simply ignore them or throw them away. He also said that more and more consumers are falling victim to deceptive marketing practices  which essentially encourage them to buy policies with high costs and limited benefits. Consumers cant make real choices because the insurance industry doesnt use standard terms or definitions. And consumers cant challenge insurance companies decisions because the companies dont explain the terms of coverage in clear, understandable language. When insurance companies fail to meet their obligations to these people, it literally becomes a matter of life and death. Thats why since March, Ive been holding a series of hearings in the Commerce panel to get to the bottom of these misleading practices and demanding explanations from companies like CIGNA. And its why I wholeheartedly believe that holding insurance companies  including self-insured plans  accountable for their actions has to be at the heart of any true health care reform. Insurance companies have seen their profits soar by more than 400 percent since 2001, while premiums for consumers have doubled. Right now, the insurance industry is profit-driven when it should be patient-driven. Theyre unfairly raising prices, cutting people out of coverage for pre-existing conditions and, as one report I released through the committee revealed, systematically overcharging consumers who choose to see doctors outside of their networks. To fight back, I have introduced the Consumers Health Care Act. In addition to creating a strong public insurance option that would put competitive pressure on insurance companies and help drive down costs, my legislation also creates Americas Health Insurance Trust  created for consumers and run by consumers. The presidents speech marked the first time the public option has been clearly explained to the American people. He reopened the door to a serious discussion about a public insurance option  and the time to have that discussion is now. Our goal is comprehensive reform and that takes work, long hours, some disagreement, a lot of coming together and a deep commitment to bringing families real solutions once and for all. I share the presidents confidence and resolve that we will succeed. Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D-W.Va.) is chairman of the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee and the Senate Finance Subcommittee on Health Care."

""We need earmark reform,"" Obama said in September during a presidential debate in Oxford, Miss. ""And when I'm president, I will go line by line to make sure that we are not spending money unwisely."" President Barack Obama should prepare to carve out a lot of free time and keep the coffee hot this week as Congress prepares to unveil a $410 billion omnibus spending bill that's riddled with thousands of earmarks, despite his calls for restraint and efforts on Capitol Hill to curtail the practice. The bill will contain about 9,000 earmarks totaling $5 billion, congressional officials say. Many of the earmarks — loosely defined as local projects inserted by members of Congress — were inserted last year as the spending bills worked their way through various committees. So while Obama and McCain were slamming earmarks on the campaign trail, House and Senate members — Democrats and Republicans — were slapping them into spending bills. ""It will be a little embarrassing for the president if he signs a bill with that many earmarks on it,"" said Stan Collender, a veteran Washington budget analyst. ""He'll say they're left over from the Bush years, and he as to say that next year the bill will be clean."" Experts agree that most earmarks are legitimate. Cary Leahey, senior economist with Decision Economics in New York, said the nation's economic crisis is a contributing factor to the plethora of earmarks. Lawmakers can argue that for a relatively small price they've helped boost the economy. ""One congressman's earmark is another legislative way to fix a serious problem in his district,"" Leahey said. Kenneth Thomas, a lecturer in finance at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of business, agrees. ""I generally believe that the priority is getting money into the system sooner rather than later, especially if it's for projects that will use local contractors and create jobs,"" he said. Still, it wasn't supposed to be this way. Earmarks have come under fire because of those that seem to provide what Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, calls ""laugh lines,"" such as Alaska's ""Bridge to Nowhere"" or North Dakota's Lawrence Welk Museum. Obama pledged to take a hard hand on earmarks and warned lawmakers in a Feb. 3 letter from Budget Director Peter Orszag not to decorate the recently signed $787.2 billion stimulus bill with them. Democrats declared the bill earmark-free. Republicans disagreed. ""While this bill does not include traditional earmarks, we should all understand that there are earmarks in this bill,"" said Sen. Mike Enzi, R-Wyo. ""There is $850 million ... to bail out Amtrak, a $75 million earmark for the Smithsonian, a $1 billion earmark for the 2010 census."" Democrats have been trying to revamp the earmark process for about two years. In 2007, they instituted a system that required members to explain the contents of each earmark, as well as a justification for why it was included in the legislation that way. They claimed this led to a reduction in earmarks by as much as 43 percent. But critics contended the system still had problems. Simply making information more available, they said, didn't address the major criticism: That such projects should go through the regular legislative process, subject to detailed hearings and bipartisan votes. Not only does this mean the public has no chance to challenge questionable spending, but too often powerful interests who know how to work the system get favorite measures inserted. For instance, Congressional Quarterly reported recently that more than 100 House members got earmarks for clients of the PMA Group, a lobbying firm with close ties to Rep. John Murtha, D-Pa., who heads the powerful defense spending subcommittee. The CQ Politics analysis said that in the 2009 defense spending bill, which Congress approved last year, PMA clients got about $300 million. The CQ study came after reports that the FBI is investigating the possibility of illegal campaign contributions by PMA to Murtha and other lawmakers. A Murtha spokesman said earlier this month that the FBI probe has nothing to do with Murtha. A PMA spokesman declined to comment on the probe. Appropriations committee chairmen say they are on track to reform the earmark process beginning in fiscal 2010 by requiring members to make public their requests early, so the public can scrutinize them and presumably contact lawmakers. The change, though, doesn't apply to the 2009 funding that Congress will consider next week. Several experts believe that dramatically reducing the number of earmarks, while a laudable goal, is almost impossible. But others contend that earmarks aren't that big of a problem. ""Earmarks get more attention than they deserve,"" said MacGuineas. ""The problem is that they cause a loss of confidence in the whole budget process."""
42,politifact986,0,http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/21/business/21cong.html?pagewanted=1&ref=business,Administration Is Seeking $700 Billion for Wall Street,"WASHINGTON  The Bush administration on Saturday formally proposed a vast bailout of financial institutions in the United States, requesting unfettered authority for the Treasury Department to buy up to $700 billion in distressed mortgage-related assets from the private firms. The proposal, not quite three pages long, was stunning for its stark simplicity. It would raise the national debt ceiling to $11.3 trillion. And it would place no restrictions on the administration other than requiring semiannual reports to Congress, granting the Treasury secretary unprecedented power to buy and resell mortgage debt. “This is a big package, because it was a big problem,” President Bush said Saturday at a White House news conference, after meeting with President Álvaro Uribe of Colombia. “I will tell our citizens and continue to remind them that the risk of doing nothing far outweighs the risk of the package, and that, over time, we’re going to get a lot of the money back.” After a week of stomach-flipping turmoil in the financial system, and with officials still on edge about how global markets will respond, the delivery of the administration’s plan set the stage for a four-day brawl in Congress. Democratic leaders have pledged to approve a bill but say it must also include tangible help for ordinary Americans in the form of an economic stimulus package."

Huckabee Crosses Picket Line—Again,"Television and movie writers who have been on strike since Nov. 5 will meet tomorrow in New York City and Los Angeles to discuss a potential tentative agreement that could end the strike. The Writers Guild of America members have been fighting to win a fair share of revenue for their work distributed online, through DVDs and other new media. Also on the strike front, Republican presidential candidate and former Gov. Mike Huckabee (Ark.) crossed another picket line (See below.). Officials of the Writers Guild of America, East ( WGAE), Writers Guild of America, West (WGAW) and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP) have been meeting informally since Jan. 24, the first meetings between the two sides since the producers walked out of negotiations in December. In a letter to their members posted on both unions’ websites today, WGAE President Michael Winship and WGAW President Patric Verrone say: We are continuing to negotiate the terms of a tentative agreement with the AMPTP. We anticipate that we will be able to present the terms of that agreement to you in the next few days. In order to have a full discussion with you of the terms and how they were reached, and in order to get your input before making recommendations or decisions, we have scheduled membership meetings for current-active members only for this Sat., February 9, in New York and Los Angeles. We urge you to attend. We have gotten to this point in our negotiation as the direct result of the power of this strike, which each of you has generated. Neither the Negotiating Committee, nor the East Council or the West Board, will take action on any contract until after the membership meetings are held and your voices have been heard. We are all in this together. This afternoon, several hundred writers rallied and marched at the Time Warner Center in New York City. Both sides have agreed to a news blackout so details of the possible tentative agreement are not available. Meanwhile, Writers Guild members met Huckabee with angry resistance last night as he crossed a picket line to be a guest on “The Colbert Report.” This is how the WGAE website describes the episode: As his black SUV arrived outside the set, 20 or so picketers swarmed in close, shouting things such as “Don’t cross Governor!” and “This is a struck show!” As Mr. Huckabee’s security team led him toward the guest entrance WGA members persisted in their attempt to persuade him not to cross, shouting and holding up signs that read “Huckabee Don’t Cross (Again)” & “Huckabee Supports Scabs.” This strong union action was captured on film by reporters from CNN and NBC, who were there on the scene to record his appearance. Mr. Huckabee gained notoriety by being the first guest for Jay Leno the night the TV host returned to work without his writers on January 3rd. On Jan. 30, Republican front-runner Sen. John McCain (Ariz.) crossed a writers’ picket line to appear on the Leno show."

JENKINS: OPIOID CRISIS FUNDING SHOULD BE BASED ON NEED,"WASHINGTON – U.S. Representative Evan Jenkins (R-W.Va.) is continuing to push for passage of his legislation to ensure federal opioid epidemic funding goes to the states most affected, like West Virginia. The federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Administration announced on Monday that West Virginia will be receiving $330,000 in additional funding, as our state has the highest overdose death rate in the nation. This supplemental funding was needed because the formula for funding under the 21st Century Cures Act sent large amounts of funding to populous states, while states most impacted saw smaller amounts and had unmet needs. “I appreciate and welcome this additional funding to help our state combat the drug crisis. Federal agencies must prioritize aid to the states struggling the most, and West Virginia must be at the very top of the list. President Trump unveiled his opioid response plan this week, and it is time for Congress to pass my legislation to make sure that West Virginia and other states hardest hit by the drug crisis get the resources they need to truly make an impact in combating this epidemic. We must to everything possible to help people in need find recovery and stop the flood of opioids and other drugs into our communities,” Rep. Jenkins said. The 21st Century Cures Act, bipartisan legislation signed into law in 2016, included $1 billion in funding to address the drug crisis. In distributing these funds, the U.S. Health and Human Services Department and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration relied on a funding formula that benefited states with larger populations. The Federal Opioid Response Fairness Act, introduced by Jenkins and Rep. Annie Kuster (D-N.H.), would make clear that per capita overdose deaths should be a part of the formula used to distribute 21st Century Cures Act funding. The introduction of this bill followed an announcement by the U.S. Health and Human Services Department and SAMHSA that there would be no change in the funding formula for the distribution of opioid State Targeted Response grants."

The wording of the recall statement had to be approved by the company before the Food and Drug Administration could publish it under current rules. The agency relies on cooperation from food makers to ensure the safety of the food supply even when those makers are suspected of crimes. Some Democrats in Congress have vowed to change this by giving the F.D.A. more authority, and the agency’s critics say it is too timid with the power it has. On Monday, President Obama promised a “complete review of F.D.A. operations.” “I think that the F.D.A. has not been able to catch some of these things as quickly as I expect them to catch,” Mr. Obama said in an interview on the “Today” show."

You need better ones, you design and build better ones. When prison populations fall--well, thats a more difficult matter. How do we keep an appropriate number of prisons on line and available to house--and hopefully rehabilitate--a prison population that is in flux? Even with violent-crime rates trending downward nationwide, how do we prepare for a potential rise in the numbers of extremely violent offenders who require special facilities--like the highly touted Supermax prisons? The answer is the same as it would be for schools, shopping malls and highways: You build them based on your current and expected needs. And you hope theyll be used. In 1994, the federal government opened its first Supermax prison in Florence, Colo., dubbed the Alcatraz of the Rockies. In the years that followed, many state departments of corrections built their own. Supermax prisons, also known as Special (or Security) Handling Units or Control Handling Units, are known for their strict lockdown policies, lack of amenities and prisoner isolation techniques. Escapes from Supermaxes are so rare they're statistically inconsequential. However, as good as these prisons are at keeping our worst offenders in check, the purpose of the Supermax is in flux. Originally set up to house the most violent, hardened and escape-prone criminals, Supermaxes are instead used for leaders of criminal organizations and gangs, serial killers, persistent rule-breakers and political criminals like spies and terrorists. The Supermaxes maintained by the Federal Bureau of Prisons in Marion, Ill., and Florence, Colo., incarcerate a total of 1,710 people, including such notable criminals as ""Unabomber"" Ted Kaczynski and Oklahoma City bombing co-conspirator Terry Nichols. In the United States alone, some 7 million people are under the control of the criminal justice system. About 2.1 million are behind bars, while another 4.9 million are on probation, parole or some other type of community correction. Only a fraction of these populations find themselves in a Supermax facility. In 1998, approximately 20,000 inmates were locked up in this type of prison, representing less than 2% of all the men and women currently incarcerated across the country. Most of the Supermaxes in the United States, such as the federal facility in Florence, are brand new or nearly so. Others are simply free-standing prisons that were retrofitted. According to a study by the Urban Institute, the per-cell cost of a Supermax is about $75,000 annually, compared to $25,000 for each cell in an ordinary state prison. You can see the problem: We have plenty of super-expensive Supermax facilities--two-thirds of the states now have them. But they were designed when crime was considered a growing problem, and now we have a remarkably lower violent-crime rate showing no real signs a turn for the worse. What to do? How do we use these pricey islands of ultimate correction? No self-respecting state director of the corrections or correctional planner will admit that the Supermax concept was a mistake. And youd be wrong to think that these prisons can be replaced by something drastically less costly. But prison experts are beginning to realize that, just like a shrinking city that finds itself with too many schools or fire departments, the Supermax model must be made more flexible in order to justify its size and budget. One solution is to house different types of prisoners. Earlier this month, Wisconsin Department of Corrections officials announced that over the past 16 years, the states Supermax facility in Boscobel--built to the tune of $47.5 million (in 1990 dollars) and with a capacity of 500 inmates--has always stood at 100 cells less than its capacity. It will now be housing maximum security prisoners--serious offenders, but a step down from the worst of the worst. The Maryland Correctional Adjustment Center, aka the Baltimore Supermax prison, opened in 1989 at a cost of $21 million (in 1989 dollars) with room for 288 inmates. Like its cousin in Wisconsin, the structure has never been at capacity. Not only does it hold the state's most dangerous prisoners, it also houses 100 or so inmates who are working their way through the federal courts, and serves as the home for Marylands ten death row convicts. Converting cells is one approach, but not the only one. Other ideas include building more regional Supermaxes, and filling them by shifting populations from other states. This would allow us to completely empty out a given Supermax, and then close it down or convert it to another use. Theres also the possibility that some elements of the Supermax model could be combined with the approaches of traditional prisons, creating a hybrid that serves a wider population. But different types of prisoners would have to be kept well away from each other--a logistical problem of no small concern. Its worth considering that the Supermax model--which includes prisoner isolation for 23 out of every 24 hours a day--may be serving as a deterrent to some violent criminals, a kind of brightly lit billboard that advertises the life of rather extreme measures they are facing. Theres no way to quantify that, but its not out of the realm of possibility. Whatever the solution or solutions to the issue of Supermax costs, its important to remember that an empty jail cell of any kind is an indicator to our society of one truth: We must be doing something right."

Statement by Ros-Lehtinen and King:  “It is unacceptable that U.S. taxpayers are being forced to fund Feisal Abdul Rauf’s trip to the Middle East.  “Abdul Rauf has cast blame for 9/11 on the U.S., and even refuses to call Hamas what it is – a Foreign Terrorist Organization.  “This radical is a terrible choice to be one of the faces of our country overseas. The U.S. should be using public diplomacy programs to combat extremism, not endorse it.  “The State Department’s selection of Feisal Abdul Rauf to represent the American people through this program further calls into question the Administration’s policy and funding priorities.”  Background: In an interview televised just 19 days after the attacks against America on September 11, 2001, Abdul Rauf cast blame for them on the U.S. He called the attacks “a reaction against the U.S. Government politically… I wouldn’t say that the United States deserved what happened, but United States policies were an accessory to the crime that happened… We have been accessory to a lot of innocent lives dying in the world. In fact, in the most direct sense, Osama bin Laden is made in the USA.”  Note: On Monday, State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley called Abdul Rauf “a distinguished Muslim cleric” and noted that the State Department “send[s] people from Muslim communities here in this country around the world to help people overseas understand our society and the role of religion within our society.”"

Rand Paul, R-Ky., took aim at the newly released House GOP budget, saying it falls far short of what needs to be done to deal with the federal deficit. ""It's really not going to touch the problem,"" Paul said. ""There's a disconnect between Republicans who want a balanced budget but aren't maybe yet brave enough to talk about the cuts to come."" The plan by House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, R-Wis., released on Thursday, would cut non-security discretionary spending by $58 billion by the end of fiscal year 2011, which ends on Sept. 30. In an far-ranging interview aboard the Capitol Subway, Paul embraced the label ""true believer"" and said staying true to the principles of the Tea Party movement is more important to him than being a Republican. He also refused to rule out a future run for president and suggested it may be time to reduce U.S. force levels in Afghanistan. Paul has proposed his own plan to cut spending by $500 billion this year. Paul's plan would impose deep across-the-board spending cuts -- including a reduction of 83 percent from the Department of Education, 6 percent from the Department of Defense and the elimination all foreign aid. He considers it just a start. ""I go to a tea party and you know what they say to me? It's not enough. It's not enough. Where's the other trillion you need?"" Paul said. Paul defended his call to end to all foreign aid -- including the $3 billion the U.S. gives to Israel every year. ""I'm not singling out Israel. I support Israel. I want to be known as a friend of Israel,"" Paul said, ""but not with money you don't have. We can't just borrow from our kids' future and give it to countries even if they are our friends."" Paul has come under fire from supporters of Israel, but said Israel has enough financial resources to fend for itself. ""I think they're an important ally, but I also think that their per capita income is greater than probably three-fourths of the rest of the world,"" Paul said. ""Should we be giving free money or welfare to a wealthy nation? I don't think so."" And military resources, as well. ""I think they're probably 10 years ahead of any neighboring country,"" he said. ""I think that their defense is very significant and probably well in advance of any of their particular enemies."" Regarding Afghanistan, Paul said it is up to the president to determine troop levels, but, ""I personally think you can have a much smaller presence."" As for his own political allegiances, Paul made it clear he is a Tea Party activist first and a Republican second. ""There are always problems in our nation's capitol that are more important than party affiliation and I will always believe that,"" Paul said. ""It's not necessarily Tea Party versus Republican Party, but I would say that if you ask me what's more important, tackling our nation's deficit, our nation's debt problems or being a Republican, I would say tackling the debt."""

Noting that Wall Street this week is trading at record-high levels, the California Democrat said those gains have done nothing to benefit middle-class workers, and called on Congress to close the gap.  ""This week, we saw something quite remarkable, the stock market soaring to record heights. At the same time, we see productivity keeping pace,"" Pelosi told reporters in the Capitol. ""But we don't see income for America's middle class rising. In fact, it's been about the same as since the end of the Clinton years.""  ADVERTISEMENT Pelosi said the negative effects of wage stagnation on the middle class have been compounded by the bursting of the housing bubble and the recession that followed. She urged Congress to take up legislation — sponsored by Sen.(D-Iowa) and Rep. George Miller (D-Calif.) — to hike the minimum wage from $7.25 to $10.10 over three years, while indexing future increases to inflation.""If we are going to honor our commitment to the middle class,"" she said, ""we have to reflect that intention in our public policy.""The Democrats' bill goes much further than President Obama advocated in his February State of the Union address, in which he urged an increase to $9 per hour. Harkin said recently that Obama ""missed the mark"" with the lower figure.Pelosi's comments came in a week when the Dow Jones Industrial Average topped 14,200 for the first time in history even as wages, as a percentage of the economy, are at an historic low (43.5 percent of GDP last year) and the nation's unemployment rate has hung stubbornly near 8 percent for roughly six months.Economists say several factors can explain why corporate profits are not trickling down to benefit the working class, including the ever-rising productivity of the nation's workforce and a reluctance among companies to hire in a still-volatile economy.Congress last approved a minimum-wage hike in 2007 as a rider to a must-pass bill providing funds to the troops in the Iraq War. The wage hike was conditioned on the inclusion of $5 billion in business tax breaks. The package was signed into law by then-President George W. Bush.With the business lobby warning that a minimum-wage hike wold cripple hiring amid a jobs crisis, the Harkin-Miller bill has little chance of moving through the GOP-controlled House. But Pelosi and the Democrats are hoping the combination of soaring Wall Street gains and middle-class wage stagnation will resonate with voters.""When we increased it in 2007 ... it was the first time it had been increased in 11 years,"" Pelosi said. ""It's time for it to be increased again."""

McCain brought up the “Gang of 14” saga unprompted at a town hall here, in advance of a major speech on judicial appointments he is set to deliver tomorrow in Winston-Salem. “I know what bipartisanship is,” McCain said. “I am going to talk tomorrow again about our Gang of 14: seven Republicans, seven Democrats that got together rather than blow up the Senate, and we confirmed so many federal judges.” In the spring of 2005, McCain and 13 other senators from both parties agreed on a compromise to avoid the so-called “nuclear option,” which would have curtailed the right of the minority to filibuster. Democrats had been filibustering to prevent the confirmation of three conservative judicial nominees named by President Bush. McCain said he took pride in his votes to confirm Supreme Court Justices John Roberts and Samuel Alito, a line that drew applause from assembled members of the Charlotte Chamber of Commerce. The Arizona senator also seemed to move past his usual “secure the borders first” mantra in favor of calling for, as he put it, “comprehensive immigration reform."" Last summer, McCain and Sen. Edward Kennedy led the charge on an immigration reform package that aroused the ire of conservatives and ultimately threatened to undermine McCain's then-frontrunning presidential bid. (McCain also supported immigration reform bills in 2005 and 2006.) “Unless we enact comprehensive immigration reform I don’t think you can take it piecemeal,” he explained Monday, answering a question about providing visas for skilled workers. “In other words,” he said, “because as soon you and I start to talk about the highly skilled workers, our agricultural interest people are going to say, ‘Look we need ag workers, too.’ And then somebody’s going say, 'We need the DREAM Act,' and then somebody’s going to say, 'We’ve got to enforce our border.'” Throughout the Republican primary battle last fall, McCain faced relentless questions about his support for the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act, the 2007 bill that would have allowed illegal immigrants to remain in the United States if they faced certain penalties. Opponents labeled it “amnesty.” Since clinching the nomination, McCain has largely avoided speaking about wide-ranging immigration reform, arguing primarily that the government needs to focus on securing the border with Mexico before taking on other measures. On Monday, he lobbied for a broader approach that includes a temporary guest worker program and tamper-proof ID cards. “We get in this kind of a circular firing squad on immigration reform in the Congress of the United States,"" McCain said, ""and the lesson I learned from it is we’ve got to have comprehensive immigration reform.”"

The legislation unequivocally opposes releasing terrorists from the Guantanamo Bay facility and transferring them to the United States, makes clear that governors and state legislatures must pre-approve the transfer or release of any terrorist detainee into their respective states, and requires the Administration to meet strict criteria and certification standards before terrorists housed at the Guantanamo prison could be brought to the United States. Republican Leader John Boehner (R-OH) issued the following statement on the legislation:   “This bill has a straightforward but vital purpose: to ensure that the terrorists held in the Guantanamo Bay prison are not imported into the United States. We are giving every member of Congress an opportunity to stand with the American people by affirming their opposition to bringing these terrorists into our communities, and we hope they join us. Equally as important, this bill holds the Administration accountable if it acts unilaterally against the will of the American people. “The world did not suddenly become safe in January 2009. There are still terrorists around the world who are committed to killing Americans and destroying our way of life. A number of those terrorists are being held at the prison in Guantanamo Bay right now. If the Administration is allowed to proceed, they won’t be there for long. In fact, they may be right here, in the United States. I have been urging the Administration to finally present to the American people its plan for what to do with the terrorists held at Guantanamo and for confronting and defeating the global terrorist threat. Right now, that plan does not exist, and the safety of our nation depends on it. “Our ranking members John McHugh, Pete Hoekstra, Lamar Smith, Peter King, and Ileana Ros-Lehtinen all deserve great credit for their work on this measure. I thank them for their efforts in crafting this critically important bill.” NOTE: Following is a summary of the Keep Terrorists Out of America Act: Affirming Congress’ Opposition to the Release and Transfer of Terrorists. The bill affirms Congress’ opposition to transferring or releasing terrorists held at the Guantanamo Bay prison into the United States. Most Americans do not support releasing these terrorists from Guantanamo Bay prison and transferring them into the United States. The bill gives Congress an opportunity to show that it stands with the American people on this critical matter, and opposes the release and transfer of these terrorists. Governor & State Legislature Pre-Approval. The measure prohibits the Administration from transferring or releasing any terrorist detainees at Guantanamo Bay to any state without express approval from the state’s governor and legislature, and certifies to Congress that strict requirements have been met. For example, the Administration must certify to the respective governor and state legislature that the detainee does not pose a security risk to the United States. The certifications must be made 60 days before any transfer or release. Presidential Certification Requirements. The measure prohibits the President from transferring or releasing a terrorist detainee into the United States unless he provides the following notification and certification to Congress regarding:  - The name of the detainee and transfer/release location in the United States.  - The release/transfer would not negatively impact continued prosecution of the detainee.  - The release/transfer would not negatively impact continued detention of the detainee.  - The ability of federal judges to release detainees into the United States."

Bernie Sanders on Saturday made good on his promise to support legislation to amend a 2005 law on firearms manufacturers’ liability. “I’m pleased that this legislation is being introduced,” Sanders said of proposals by Sen. Richard Blumenthal and Rep. Adam Schiff to rescind portions of a law granting broad immunity from lawsuits to gun manufacturers and dealers. “As I have said for many months now, we need to look at the underlying law and tighten it up,” Sanders added. Sanders called it “good news” that the Senate and House bills proposed by Blumenthal and Schiff would leave in place provisions in the 2005 law that require child safety locks on guns and ban armor-piercing ammunition. “Those were important provisions that I did support,” he said. Sanders also renewed his concern that the law should not subject the owners of small gun stores, which have not acted negligently, to lawsuits. “As I have said, I do want to make sure that this legislation does not negatively impact small gun stores in rural America that serve the hunting community. So I’m pleased to support the legislation and should it come up for consideration I would work to make sure it includes a provision that allows us to monitor its impact so that we may determine if it is having any unintended consequences.” Sanders proposed amendment to the Blumenthal and Schiff bills would require the Commerce Department to monitor and report on the law’s impact in rural areas on the availability of hunting supplies, including firearms, sold by non-negligent local gun stores. Sanders amendment would add this section to the proposed legislation: Sec. 3. Protection of non-negligent rural mom and pop hunting stores. The Secretary of Commerce shall monitor the impact of this statute, if any, on the availability of hunting supplies, including firearms, in rural communities from non-negligent local sellers. Within six months of enactment, and every six months thereafter, the Secretary shall transmit the results of the monitoring to the Committee on the Judiciary of the United States House of Representatives and United States Senate, respectively."

The Times reported that “[t]his was the year of the return to financial sobriety.” Unfortunately, the same can’t be said for out-of-touch Washington Democrats. Michael Mandel, the chief economist at Business Week, noted that “Most other journalists and economists have take [sic] the same position-that Americans have reacted to the recession by saving more. But for the U.S. economy as a whole, the savings rate has not gone up-it’s actually fallen.” How can that be? The answer is simple: government spending has exploded over the past year, which explains the discrepancies in the following chart: Mandel explained: What we see here is that the net national savings-the sum of personal, corporate, and government savings, net of depreciation-has been plunging rather than rising. The net national savings rate fell to -2.5% in the third quarter of 2009, its lowest level since the Great Depression. That’s astounding low… the government is running such big deficits that they swamp the savings gains in the private sectors . Here’s another way of putting it: The government is borrowing a lot of money and transferring it to the private sector, through fiscal and monetary stimulus. The private sector is using some of those transfers to boost savings. But on net, the country’s savings rate as a whole is falling. In other words, the federal government is overwhelming the private sector with deficit spending. The House Budget Committee Republican Staff complied a lengthy list of all the Democrats’ spending in last year: Democrats need to abandon their job-killing agenda that’s burdening families and small businesses with tax hikes and burying our kids and grandkids under a mountain of debt. All year long, House Republicans have been offering better solutions on the budget, energy, and health care - solutions that recognize that we need to empower the American people, not bureaucrats in Washington, D.C.

Coming a day after the announcement across the Pacific that President Obama will attend the beginning of the summit, bringing a commitment to reduce U.S. emissions ""in the range of 17%"" from 2005 levels by 2020, this means that we now know what the world's two largest emitters will be bringing to the table when the world's countries gather in Copenhagen. The official announcement (in Chinese here) notes that on November 25, Premier Wen Jiabao and the State Council standing committee met and decided upon the 2020 target and corresponding measures to achieve it. Of note are the following points: 1.) What exactly does the carbon intensity target cover? China will reduce its carbon intensity, the CO2 emitted per unit GDP, by 40 to 45 percent from 2005 levels by 2020. This carbon intensity target will measure only the CO2 emissions from energy consumption and industrial activity, the source of most of China's emissions, and does not take into account efforts to reduce emissions or increase sinks from land use and forestry. This makes sense given that estimating emissions from land use and forestry is less precise than measuring emissions from fuel combustion and industrial activity, both of which are also more tightly linked to GDP than land use and forestry.

How will this be implemented? In order to measure the progress it is making in achieving this target, China will include the carbon intensity target in its medium and long-term social and economic development plans and develop corresponding statistics, monitoring and evaluation systems to measure progress. Thus, we can expect that the next five year plan (2010-2015) will include systems for monitoring and evaluating officials' and enterprises' performance in meeting the specific carbon intensity reduction targets allocated to them, similar to how the government implemented its target setting and official evaluation system for the twenty percent energy intensity reduction target in the current 11th Five Year Plan.

Will the target be binding internationally? At the moment, the carbon intensity target is only a voluntary action and is not intended to be binding internationally. However, the carbon intensity reduction targets will be mandatory (""约束性"") domestically for provinces and enterprises within China, similar to how the current energy intensity targets are mandatory, with consequences for officials of provinces and enterprises who do not meet their assigned targets.

However, the carbon intensity reduction targets will be mandatory (""约束性"") domestically for provinces and enterprises within China, similar to how the current energy intensity targets are mandatory, with consequences for officials of provinces and enterprises who do not meet their assigned targets. 4.) Is the 40 - 45% target significant? Although there is debate about how much of a reduction this 40 to 45 percent carbon intensity reduction target is from a ""business as usual"" scenario, we should keep in mind a few points. First, how we define ""business as usual"" matters. As part of its current 11th Five Year Plan, China took on a goal of reducing its energy intensity by 20% from 2006-10, which has led to a coordinated energy efficiency program that includes actions such as closing down smaller, inefficient power plants and outdated, inefficient iron and steel, cement and other manufacturing capacity, and improving the efficiency of the Top 1,000 energy consuming enterprises. If China succeeds in reducing its energy intensity by 20% by 2010, this would result in the avoidance of a billion tons of CO2 emissions. China should be given credit for these efforts and not penalized for taking early action. Second, the International Energy Agency has noted that the commitments from China and the US are roughly in line with the actions they have estimated to be necessary to reach a concentration of 450 parts CO2 per million, what scientists have deemed is necessary to keep global temperatures from rising more than two degrees Celsius. While we would hope that both China and the U.S. will seek to raise the level of their ambition, both proposals are substantial and require real improvements in energy efficiency and low-carbon energy to achieve. The other important thing to remember is the significance of the carbon intensity target for creating the proper framework and incentives for reducing emissions. As noted above, a carbon intensity target will require each province and major enterprise to measure, report and reduce their CO2 emissions and energy consumption, year-on-year, acting as a driver for greater efficiency and renewables. In this way, the carbon intensity target is similar to the US greenhouse gas mandatory reporting rule or the cap-and-trade system in the current climate legislation before Congress, which put in place the proper incentives and systems to transition to a low-carbon, clean energy economy. Provinces, local governments and enterprises will need to establish and improve systems for measuring and reporting emissions, and there will be increasing pressure on these enterprises and provinces to enact measures within their development plans for making continuous improvements in energy efficiency and renewable energy. At the national level, China will need to continue and accelerate its policies to boost energy efficiency and renewables, and it will need to build its capacity to measure and report emissions for its national greenhouse gas inventory on a yearly basis (something which EPA and China's National Development and Reform Commission have recently agreed to cooperate on). Just as important as the targets they have set for themselves, China and the US must continue to accelerate their efforts to develop low carbon economies based on energy efficiency, renewables, and the development of clean technologies such as smart grids and electric vehicles. Both countries stand to benefit from the transition to a clean energy economy, by growing new clean industries and jobs, reducing their independence on dirty fossil fuels, and reducing their contribution to climate change and environmental damage. China can achieve a substantial reduction in its carbon intensity while continuing to grow its economy and providing an improved standard of living and a better environment for its citizens. China's carbon intensity target is certainly a step in the right direction, and it provides the right incentives for future improvements in reducing emissions. Following the U.S.'s own emissions reduction announcement and the recent bilateral clean energy initiatives announced during President Obama's visit, we are beginning to see the outlines for a meaningful framework agreement in Copenhagen and a foundation for both countries to demonstrate leadership in addressing climate change."

Still, only 27 percent of 19-to-29-year-olds are aware of the marketplaces. Meanwhile, most uninsured young adults living below poverty will not have access to subsidized public or private insurance in states opting out of the Medicaid expansion."

The revisions provide more specific guidance to FDIC-supervised institutions to ensure that this high-cost, short-term credit product is not provided repeatedly to customers with longer-term credit needs. There is currently a small number of FDIC-supervised institutions engaged in payday lending. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) is issuing the attached revised examination guidance on payday lending programs. The revisions provide more specific guidance with respect to the appropriate limits on payday loan use to ensure that this high-cost, short-term credit product is not provided repeatedly to customers with longer-term credit needs. Payday loans are small-dollar, unsecured, short-term advances that have high fees relative to the size of the loan. When used frequently or for long periods, the total costs can rapidly exceed the amount borrowed. The FDIC initially issued guidance on payday lending in July 2003 because payday lending is a high-risk activity that presents significant safety and soundness and consumer protection concerns. The FDIC's concerns about payday lending have been heightened as it has observed payday lending conducted in a manner that is inconsistent with the July 2003 guidance and inconsistent with prudent lending practices. The FDIC believes that providing high-cost, short-term credit on a recurring basis to customers with long-term credit needs is not responsible lending; increases institutions' credit, legal, reputational, and compliance risks; and can create a serious financial hardship for the customer. To reduce these risks and promote responsible lending, the revised guidance states that institutions should ensure that payday loans are not provided to customers who have had payday loans outstanding from any lender for a total of three months in the previous 12- month period. When a customer has used payday loans more than three months in the past 12 months, institutions should offer the customer, or refer the customer to, an alternative longer-term credit product that more appropriately suits the customer's needs. In any event, whether or not an institution is able to provide a customer alternative credit products, an extension of a payday loan is not appropriate under such circumstances. Other key provisions of the July 2003 guidance remain unchanged. FDIC-supervised institutions engaged in payday lending have been instructed to submit plans detailing how they will address the revised guidance. In addition, the FDIC anticipates using a mystery shopper program in conjunction with its examination process of institutions involved in payday lending."
58,politifact8621,0,http://www.acton.org/pub/commentary/2012/02/08/obamacare-vs-catholic-bishops,Obamacare vs. the Catholic bishops,"I recently completed a very short interview on Vatican Radio to discuss the current battle between the Obama administration and the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. It didn’t permit me to say more than that the Obama administration is making a political mistake, so I’d like to say a bit more about the serious consequences that will likely result and how we ended up with this Church-State conundrum in the first place. As Dr. Donald Condit has already explained, the Obama administration seems to be making a political calculation that this controversy will blow over before the November’s presidential election, because the conscience exemption for providing and paying for abortion, sterilization, and contraception will not take effect until later next year. But the miscalculation was predictable and is now evident, with not only Catholics, but Orthodox, evangelical, Jewish and other religious leaders taking a stand. Unless the administration relents or the Obamacare law is ruled unconstitutional, Catholic hospitals and other institutions will be faced with a choice between not providing insurance coverage to their employees – and thereby being fined by the government – or pay for the provision of services that they believe are morally evil. A journalist friend in Rome just raised an alternative reading of the story to me on the street. What if Obama is actually making a principled argument that abortion, sterilization, and contraception services are a fundamental aspect of women’s health that cannot and should not be denied to anyone, regardless of their own religious or individual convictions? Perhaps the White House believes, as most progressives do, that these stodgy, uptight opponents will eventually, inevitably, be overcome, and we will one day wonder what all the fuss about. If so, the administration is doing much more than thinking about the next election; it’s redefining what the word “health” means to include measures that violently take away life from the most innocent and vulnerable persons, regardless of who pays for the services. This makes it much more than a religious freedom or a conscience issue and a matter of simple justice. More generally, the whole Obamacare mess is a result of employer-provided health insurance. We would all be better off if our health insurance was decoupled from our employment, and we were free to purchase our own insurance according to our needs and wants. It is a result of state intervention in the economy, namely wage-and-price controls, that led to employers offering health insurance as a non-wage benefit to entice desired employees to their companies. Now we have the government mandating that all employers must provide comprehensive coverage to all their employees. What was once a prudential individual decision has become a government-mandated “right” that trumps the employer-employee, the doctor-patient, and perhaps even the priest-penitent relationship. Some progress. There is some tragic irony to all this. We should not forget that many religious leaders have long-supported increasing the role of the state in health care and the economy at-large, perhaps thinking that conscience clauses would protect their institutions against any undue interference. Well, they were wrong; what the state giveth, the state taketh away. If you invite the state to “assist” more and more of your activities, it will eventually start telling you how to do things. Encouraging the Democratic Party’s efforts from Harry Truman on to socialize the healthcare system of the United States is likely to have dire consequences for Catholic and other religious-based social service providers. Economic ignorance among religious leaders comes at a very high cost to their own good works."

The war gamers, following a scenario created by their Army hosts, determined that U.S. troops would secure the exit route to Kuwait through largely Shiite Muslim southern Iraq and face little fighting as they drove their equipment out. Any attacks, the panel judged, would be ""harassment attacks,"" likely by a few Sunni members of al Qaida in Iraq who wanted to attack American troops one last time. ""Why would they stop us? They have been telling us to leave,"" said one participant who requested anonymity to speak freely about the war game. Once U.S. troops left, however, the chaos in Iraq would escalate. Shiite militias would drive Baghdad's Sunni population into Iraq's western Anbar province, which is almost exclusively Sunni, the war gamers concluded. There would be a power struggle within Anbar among tribes backed by outside Sunni Arab states, including Saudi Arabia and Syria. Rival Shiite factions would fight one another to control much of the rest of the country, and Iran presumably would back one side, although the gamers couldn't assess how overt Iranian interference would be. Turkey would consider entering Iraq from the north to thwart the Kurds, who desire independence and claim some of Turkey as part of their homeland. Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al Maliki's government would be unable to control the country. Indeed, the gamers concluded, his government could collapse unless Iran threw its support behind it. ""The mess we would leave behind would be awful,"" the participant said. ""The ethnic cleansing is happening now. Once we're gone, absent a political solution that would allow the Iraqi Army to go into action, all of that will be accelerated."" The Army staged the one-day exercise earlier this month at a Hilton hotel in suburban Springfield, Va., and invited 30 Iraq experts, among them serving and retired officers and Iraqi exiles. The organizers picked April 2008 as a starting point — the month after which U.S. commanders have said they can't maintain the surge of additional U.S. forces and still give troops a year off between 15-month deployments — and January 2009 as the end. They played the roles of the Sunnis, the Shiites, the insurgents, the militias, the military generals and the Iraqi government. The game was one of several simulations of what Iraq might look like in the 2009 time frame if U.S. troops leave, said retired Marine Col. Gary Anderson, who participated in the Springfield exercise and several previous such games. But he said the Army hasn't yet staged an exercise premised on an abrupt withdrawal. That the military war games are focusing on the potential chaos in Iraq, rather than an abrupt troop withdrawal, offers some insight into how the Pentagon is planning for the next stage of the war, several of the participants told McClatchy Newspapers. ""It will be as easy to get out as it was to get in,"" said one senior defense official, who declined to speak on the record about possible future operations. He said he believes that U.S. forces could get out of Iraq in as little as six months. But the military insists that there's no withdrawal plan at this time. ""Tell us the policy, and we will do it,"" one senior Pentagon official said. Critics said the military is underestimating how hard it'll be to get out of Iraq. They point to Israel's withdrawal from Lebanon, which boosted the fortunes of the militant Shiite Islamic group Hezbollah, and the Soviet Union's hasty withdrawal from Afghanistan, which cost more than 500 Soviet troops their lives. Rep. Joe Sestak, D-Pa., a retired Navy vice admiral who was director of defense policy for the National Security Council in the Clinton administration, said he believes that drawing down or withdrawing troops could be one of the most dangerous periods of the Iraq war. ""The military will be vulnerable ... You are going to go out in a combat situation,"" Sestak said. ""I think we can do greater damage if we don't have a firm grasp on the military implications."" U.S. troops are likely to leave an Iraq that's still embroiled in fierce sectarian violence, he said. ""How quickly can the military move its 160,000 troops out? What about the 100,000-plus contractors? How many of the military's 45,000 Humvees should be left behind for the Iraqi Army? Which of 64 military bases should be closed? How does the military protect its main route out of Iraq toward Kuwait?"" Sestak estimates that it would take at long as two years to withdraw. America's future in Iraq will be at center stage next month, when Gen. David Petraeus, the top U.S. military commander in Iraq, and Ryan Crocker, the U.S. envoy there, give an assessment and recommendation to Congress on Iraq's security and political situation. The war gamers' only issue was getting out and at what cost. By the end of the game, the players decided that the exercise had ""captured how bad it would be,"" said the participant who declined to be identified. ""I don't worry about how we will get out of Iraq,"" Anderson concluded about the latest war game. ""I am worried about the Iraqis we will kill on the way out."""

Clinton, who remains a heavy favorite to win the Democrat nomination, leads the presumptive GOP nominee 46 percent to 43 percent among registered voters, a difference that is within the poll’s margin of error of plus-or-minus 3.1 percentage points. In April, Clinton held an 11-point advantage over Trump, 50 percent to 39 percent, and had led him consistently by double digits since December. In a more hypothetical matchup, Democrat Bernie Sanders leads Trump by 15 points, 54 percent to 39 percent. Looking inside the numbers of her race against Trump, Clinton holds the edge among African Americans (88 percent to 9 percent), Latinos (68 percent to 20 percent), women (51 percent to 38 percent) and those ages 18 to 34 (55 percent to 32 percent). Trump, meanwhile, is ahead among whites (52 percent to 36 percent), seniors (52 percent to 41 percent), men (49 percent to 40 percent) and independents (42 percent to 37 percent). The NBC/WSJ poll — conducted May 15-19 — comes after Trump became the Republican Party's presumptive presidential nominee, but also as the ongoing Clinton-vs.-Sanders Democratic race has become more contentious in recent days. Republicans are now supporting Trump over Clinton by an 86 percent-to-6 percent margin, which is up from 72 percent to 13 percent a month ago, suggesting that GOP voters are consolidating around their presumptive nominee. Complete Coverage: Decision 2016 While Democrats are backing Clinton by an 83 percent-to-9 percent clip, just 66 percent of Democratic primary voters preferring Sanders support Clinton in a matchup against Trump (compared with 88 percent of Clinton primary voters who favor Sanders in a hypothetical general-election contest). Those numbers underscore Clinton’s challenge in winning over Sanders voters once the Democratic primary contest concludes. Mr. and Mrs. Unpopular Trump and Clinton are currently the two most unpopular likely presidential nominees in the history of the NBC/WSJ poll. Thirty four percent of registered voters have a positive opinion of Clinton, versus 54 percent who have a negative opinion (-20) — a slight uptick from her minus-24 score last month. Trump's rating is even worse than Clinton’s: Twenty nine percent have a positive opinion of him, while 58 percent have a negative opinion (-29) — an improvement from his minus-41 score in April. “This has never been matched, or even close to being matched,” Democratic pollster Peter Hart, who conducted the survey with Republican pollster Bill McInturff, says of these negative ratings for Trump and Clinton. By contrast, Sanders is in positive territory. Forty-three percent have a positive view of the Vermont senator, versus 36 percent who have a negative view (+7). One difference Clinton and Sanders: Clinton’s rating among Democratic voters supporting Sanders is 38 percent positive, 41 percent negative (-3); Sanders’ rating among Clinton supporters is 54 percent positive, 23 percent negative (+31). President Obama’s overall score in the current NBC/WSJ poll is at 49 percent positive, 41 percent negative (+8). Forty Seven Percent Would Consider a Third-Party Candidate Asked if they would consider a third-party candidate if Clinton and Trump were the major party nominees, 47 percent of registered voters say yes -- a higher percentage than those who said yes on a similar question in 2008 and 2012. Fifty percent of voters say they would not consider a third-party candidate. The NBC/WSJ poll was conducted May 15-19 of 1,000 registered voters, including 450 cell phone-only respondents and another 46 reached on a cell but who also have a landline. The overall margin of error is plus-minus 3.1 percentage points."
62,politifact8611,0,http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2013/10/2/israel-netanyahurouhaniiranpresident.html,Israel should welcome Rouhani's election victory,"Such a reaction would be understandable if Saeed Jalili , the most anti-Western ultraconservative candidate, had won. But why has the Israeli government greeted Rouhani with hostility? The common refrain in Israel is that Rouhani's moderate image — in contrast to his predecessor Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's — will hamper Israel's efforts to keep Iran isolated. Furthermore, Rouhani's moderate tone could fool the United States and Europe into a false sense of security, resulting in the lifting of sanctions against Iran and even passivity toward the threat of Iran's nuclear program. Such concern likely peaked after Rouhani's recent visit to the United Nations General Assembly, which led to a number of milestones in Iran's troubled relationship with the U.S. The meeting between Iran's foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif and U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry — the first such formal talks between the two countries since the 1978 Iranian Revolution — was followed by another major unprecedented milestone: a phone call between Rouhani and President Barack Obama. To be sure, when it comes to Rouhani's ability to usher real change to Iran's nuclear program, a healthy dose of skepticism is called for. However, his election victory is not the threat that Netanyahu and his cabinet have alleged. In fact, there are good reasons for Israelis to welcome Rouhani's rise to power. Rouhani was elected on a platform of moderation. Among the presidential candidates, he was the most critical of Iran's nuclear-negotiation strategy. His criticism focused on Iran's intransigent posture at the talks, which forced it to pay a disproportionate price for its nuclear program. As Rouhani stated in a campaign video on June 5, 10 days before the election: ""If centrifuges are turning, but the country is dormant, then we don't choose this. If the arrangement is for Natanz [Iran's nuclear enrichment site] to work but 100 other factories close because of sanctions and shortage of primary material or they only work at 20 percent of their capacity, then this is unacceptable."" Iranian President Hassan Rouhani was the most moderate candidate among those allowed to run in the country's June election. Yet within one month of Rouhani's victory, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu publicly called him a ""wolf in sheep’s clothing."" In what should be good news for Israel, Rouhani could usher in change to Iran's nuclear stance. He enjoys very good relations with Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and seems to be highly trusted by him. For 25 years Rouhani was Khamenei's representative on the Supreme National Security Council (SNSC), which shapes Iran's national security and defense policies.  In fact, Rouhani's relations with Khamenei are far better so far than that of his predecessors, Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, Mohammad Khatami and Ahmadinejad. Khamenei may not have allowed Ahmadinejad to shift Iran's nuclear strategy, despite the latter's calls for Iran to halt enrichment at 20 percent, because of bad relations between the two leaders after a public falling out in April 2011. Rouhani's rapprochement with the U.S. could also be good news for Israeli worries over Iran's nuclear ambitions. Improved relations with Iran, along with the leverage of sanctions, could give the U.S. what it needs to extract concessions from Tehran over its nuclear program.  At the same time, Rouhani's rise to power and the strengthening of his position will come at a cost to Iran's hard-liners, Israel's most ardent enemies. In fact, this is already happening: In less than two months since coming to power, Rouhani is already changing parts of Iran's stance on the Holocaust, much to the fury of Iran's ultraconservatives. Last but not least, Rouhani's election represented a victory for the tough sanctions imposed against Iran, such as the restrictions against Iran's Central Bank that Israel had demanded for many years. A military attack by Israel or the U.S., by contrast, would most probably have stiffened Iran's stance against negotiations. So now that the goal of softening Iran's stance has been achieved, it is time to reap its benefits. Netanyahu appears to believe that Rouhani cannot be trusted and must be pressured incessantly, even if he offers compromises. Netanyahu insists that Iran's entire nuclear program must be dismantled and, if Iran does not comply, military action should be taken. The irony in Netanyahu's harsh line is that it helps Rouhani politically. In Iran praise from any Israeli leaders could be detrimental. For now, Netanyahu appears to be attacking Rouhani because he genuinely doubts his sincerity and views his overtures as a threat to Israel. Let us hope that instead of hurting Rouhani, Netanyahu ends up helping him. Rouhani's diplomatic outreach could be the best opportunity Israel has seen in the last decade to find a negotiated settlement to Iran's nuclear program."
63,politifact13548,0,http://time.com/4523755/donald-trump-leaked-tape-impact/,How a Leaked Tape of Donald Trump Bragging About Groping Women Changed the 2016 Race,"The bombshell dropped on the Washington Post’s website just after 4 p.m.: a video of Donald Trump, in 2005, using extremely vulgar language to describe women, detailing his attempt to bed a married woman and bragging that he can grope women because he is a celebrity. Less than an hour later, Wikileaks published more than 2,000 emails from what appeared to be the personal account of the chairman of Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign. But not even John Podesta’s private and largely inside-baseball notes to Clinton could save Trump the lashing that was coming his way. Republicans lined up to criticize Trump’s language and attitudes toward women. His advisers worried about what else might be out there to sink their chances with just over a month until Election Day. Trump Tower was in full meltdown mode again, with some advisers urging him to make another apology and others just trying to make him see that there was a serious problem. And Trump’s Sunday night’s debate against the first woman to lead a major-party presidential ticket just became that much more of a draw in a cycle that has already broken television records. Trump initially issued a brief statement that claimed Bill Clinton had said far worse things as the pair played golf. Republicans’ freak-out did not slow, and he dropped plans to campaign in Wisconsin with House Speaker Paul Ryan. Shortly after midnight, Trump tried the apology again. “These words don’t reflect who I am. I said it. I was wrong. And I apologize,” Trump said in a straight-to-camera address that he released on social media. He likened the archived video to a distraction from the campaign he is fighting against Clinton. Then, against allies’ advice, he returned to Bill and Hillary Clinton’s marriage. “Bill Clinton has actually abused women. And Hillary has bullied, attacked, shamed and intimidated his victims. We will discuss this more in the coming days,” Trump said. It wasn’t exactly the advice many of his supporters were seeking. “Donald Trump needs to humble himself,” Trump adviser Kayleigh McEnany said on CNN, perhaps recognizing that Trump tends to listen to the talking heads on TV more than the people in his penthouse. Hearing someone who might be the next President of the United States say some of Trump’s words was too galling to notions of how one behaves in the Oval Office. “There have to be dozens of tapes like this when a candidate has diarrhea of the mouth,” Republican strategist and Trump critic Katie Packer said. Added veteran Republican Stuart Stevens: “How does any woman work for Donald Trump?” It made for a remarkable evening in an already remarkable campaign. The dueling releases came on the same day the U.S. government officially said what has been deeply suspected for a long while: Russia was looking to interfere with America’s election. In the midst of all this, the State Department’s release of more of Clinton’s own emails from her time as the nation’s top diplomat were largely an afterthought, as were Trump’s continued incorrect claims about the Central Park Five. As Trump’s candidacy appeared—yet again—to teeter on implosion, rabble-rouser hacktivist Julian Assange opened up Podesta’s Gmail account in an attempt to distract from the Trump fiasco. Trump made a feeble attempt at apologizing while his son tried to distract attention to Clinton’s emails, which he called an “October Surprise” on Twitter. All eyes stayed on Trump’s words, however. “Women have the power to stop Trump,” Clinton tweeted and posted a video of his worst statements about women. In an election that has already tested the norms of politics and the collective stomach of its voters, the distinct events—and the responses—would affect specific blocs of voters that each candidate is struggling to lock down. For Trump, his standing with female voters was at risk well before the video emerged that includes him bragging about getting away with groping women because he is a celebrity. Hearing him say “When you’re a star, they let you do it” hardly inspires the same feelings the country had for Barack Obama or Ronald Reagan. “He is talking about sexual assault. There’s no other way to frame this,” Republican strategist Amanda Carpenter told CNN, where she is a contributor. For Clinton, her top aide’s emails offered an embarrassing window into both her political calculations in private and highlights from paid speeches—a sore spot for younger voters who spent months being told by Clinton’s one-time rival Bernie Sanders that she couldn’t be trusted. In one email, sent just before Iowa’s lead-off caucuses this year, the top communications aides were brought up to speed on what Clinton had said behind closed doors. The worst possible headlines? “Clinton admits she is out of touch,” “Clinton suggests she is a moderate” and “Clinton says you need to have a private and public position on policy.” Another potential pickle is this headline: “Clinton is aware of security concerns around BlackBerries.” Republicans are obsessed with Clinton’s use of a private email server as Secretary of State, and anything involving email is likely to overshadow any of Trump’s woes in the echo chamber of conservative Twitter. Yet, as a whole, Trump’s video was more damning. Here was the candidate, on tape, engaging in what Trump himself would later call “locker-room banter” laughing about trying to bed a married woman, describing women’s appearance in crass terms and popping breath mints in case he could woo an actress, just months after his own wedding. There was no excuse for the behavior, and Republicans were not rushing to provide one. Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus, who has tried to guide Trump to more respectable ground, released a statement: “No woman should ever be described in these terms or talked about in this manner. Ever.” The 2012 Republican nominee, Mitt Romney, tweeted that “such vile degradations demean our wives and daughters and corrupt America’s face to the world.” Sen. Mark Kirk or Illinois called Trump “a malignant clown.” Sen. Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire called the remarks”totally inappropriate and offensive.” Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona said “America deserves far better” than Trump. Trump’s vanquished rival for the GOP nomination Jeb Bush said “no apology can excuse away Donald Trump’s reprehensible comments degrading women.” Trump loyalists merely said Clinton was behind the release of Trump’s video. “They did their opposition research. This is what they had,” former Rep. Michele Bachmann told MSNBC. “She has to change the narrative.” Pressed by host Chris Matthews, Bachmann said she had no evidence to back up her claim. Faith and Freedom Coalition Chairman Ralph Reed told CNN that abortion and the economy would keep Trump’s supporters firmly in their camp. “A 10-year-old tape of a private conversation with a TV talk show host ranks pretty low on their hierarchy of their concerns,” he said. That thinking might help some of Trump’s backers to justify their continued support. After all, Hillary Clinton is hardly a beloved figure after decades in public life, and antipathy runs deep in conservative circles. The release of her campaign chairman’s stolen emails will give her critics yet more fodder. But there’s a fundamental difference between aides deliberating which joke to use in a speech and the candidate himself using foul language to talk about unwanted sexual advances. If Friday night’s competing and unexpected releases are a preview of what voters should anticipate for the next month, it will be a very long October."
64,politifact408,0,http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1583539/20080317/id_0.jhtml,"Bill Clinton Says He 'Never Said A Bad Word About Senator Obama,' At mtvU's First 'Editorial Board'","On Sunday, former President Bill Clinton — whose wife, Senator Hillary Clinton, is battling for the Democratic Party's presidential nomination — fielded some tough questions from four college journalists during mtvU's ""Editorial Board"" in New Orleans. The Clinton installment of ""Editorial Board"" premieres March 26 on mtvU. While the questions were largely expected, Clinton's answers were not. The event — the first in a televised series that will give selected writers and editors from mtvU's College Media Network the opportunity to meet with some of today's most prominent political figures — provided Clinton an opportunity to set the record straight. When asked about those remarks he'd made leading up to the South Carolina primary (he pointedly compared Senator Barack Obama's candidacy to that of Jesse Jackson's in '84 and '88, which some perceived as his attempt to pigeonhole his wife's rival as the ""black"" candidate), Clinton said his remarks were blown out of proportion by a media hungry for controversy during election season. ""Contrary to the myth, I went through South Carolina and never said a bad word about Senator Obama — not one,"" he insisted. ""I went to African-American college campuses and said, 'Look, I expect most of you are going to vote against Hillary. But I want you to know that she wants your vote.' That's what we did. You can't blame the African-American community for being proud of having a candidate who's immensely impressive, who has had a lot of support in the North among non-African-Americans and has generated all this excitement among young people. I don't think it's rocket science. The fact that people are excited about Senator Obama's candidacy in the African-American community is entirely understandable."" But Clinton warned against approaching this election as though it were a popularity contest. He said while thousands of Americans have rallied around Obama's call for change, his wife has been making change for years. ""It is almost impossible to find any Democrat who has accomplished more in less time in the Senate — and with Republicans — on both domestic and foreign-policy issues and military issues"" than Hillary Clinton, he said. Bill Clinton also said that Obama has been running a campaign that suggests, ""If you were part of making good things happen in the '90s and stopping bad things from happening in this decade ... then you are part of a culture of conflict and you are so yesterday. The only way we can have a good president is to make a completely new beginning. ""This is the first election in history that I can remember where experience — and having, actually, experience as a change-maker — should be a disability for being elected,"" he added. ""All of you who are young have a right to say that, but don't pretend you're not saying that."" Later, Clinton took exception to suggestions that Obama has rejected special-interest funds in his campaign. ""[Obama] was the only one who kept his [political action committee],"" Clinton said. ""Then, in the beginning, he spends 40 percent of the PAC money — 43 percent, to be exact — on Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina politicians. Those states constitute 3.7 percent of America's population. He also admitted that his political action committee consulted with his campaign on how to spread the money out. So, therefore, it is not true that he has run a campaign without any special-interest money influencing the presidential campaign."" When asked why African-Americans' support of his wife continues to drop, Clinton pointed to Obama's caucus win in Iowa as the turning point — not the comments he made before South Carolina's primary. ""The minute it became possible that [Obama] could be the nominee, he was going to win the lion's share of the African-American vote,"" Clinton surmised. ""And I think that I never begrudged it."" The issue of drug use was also broached. Clinton famously remarked in the '90s that he had experimented with marijuana but ""never inhaled,"" and Obama has also admitted to trying cocaine as a youth. Clinton was asked whether voters might be swayed by such things from a candidate's past. ""It was also an issue when President Bush ran for the first time, because he didn't answer the cocaine question, right? ... I think the voters rendered a verdict ... that what you did when you were really young is not going to bar you from serving as president,"" he said. Clinton later told the crowd assembled for Sunday's event that he thinks Congress may abolish the ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell"" policy regarding gays serving in the military before year's end.

In particular, there’s a good case to be made that zoning policies in many states unnecessarily restrict the supply of housing, and that this is one area where Texas does in fact do something right. But what does population growth have to do with job growth? Well, the high rate of population growth translates into above-average job growth through a couple of channels. Many of the people moving to Texas — retirees in search of warm winters, middle-class Mexicans in search of a safer life — bring purchasing power that leads to greater local employment. At the same time, the rapid growth in the Texas work force keeps wages low — nearly 10 percent of hourly Texan workers earn the minimum wage or less, well above the national average — and these low wages give corporations an incentive to move production to the Lone Star State. So Texas tends, in good years and bad, to have higher job growth than the rest of America. But it needs lots of new jobs just to keep up with its rising population — and as those unemployment comparisons show, recent employment growth has fallen well short of what’s needed. If this picture doesn’t look very much like the glowing portrait Texas boosters like to paint, there’s a reason: the glowing portrait is false. Still, does Texas job growth point the way to faster job growth in the nation as a whole? No. What Texas shows is that a state offering cheap labor and, less important, weak regulation can attract jobs from other states. I believe that the appropriate response to this insight is “Well, duh.” The point is that arguing from this experience that depressing wages and dismantling regulation in America as a whole would create more jobs — which is, whatever Mr. Perry may say, what Perrynomics amounts to in practice — involves a fallacy of composition: every state can’t lure jobs away from every other state. In fact, at a national level lower wages would almost certainly lead to fewer jobs — because they would leave working Americans even less able to cope with the overhang of debt left behind by the housing bubble, an overhang that is at the heart of our economic problem. So when Mr. Perry presents himself as the candidate who knows how to create jobs, don’t believe him. His prescriptions for job creation would work about as well in practice as his prayer-based attempt to end Texas’s crippling drought."

Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, today spoke on the Senate floor in support of religious freedom. Flake invoked the nomination of Professor Amy Barrett, whose nomination to the federal bench has grown contentious due to insinuations on the part of Democrats and special-interest groups that her Catholic faith would affect her ability to be a judge.   “It is no better for Democrats to evaluate a judicial nominee based on how many books are in the Bible on which she swears her oath, than it is for Republicans to judge a congressman for the Quran on which he does the same. To suggest that somehow a Roman Catholic judge would disregard the Constitution in favor of Church doctrine—when she has emphatically and repeatedly said she would not—is as wrong as suggesting that a Muslim judge would be somehow be forced to follow sharia law over the Constitution. Religious liberty must not depend on the religion in question.”  When Barrett’s religion came up in her confirmation hearing, Flake was quick to argue that line of questioning was both inappropriate and bordered on a religious test. To view Flake and Barrett’s exchange at the hearing, click here. Following the speech, Flake voted to confirm Barrett to serve as a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit. Barrett was confirmed by a vote of 55-43. To view Flake’s speech, click here. A transcript of the prepared remarks can be viewed below. Background: On Oct. 2, Flake spoke on the Senate floor to warn against a religious test for judicial nominees. To view a video and transcript of Flake’s remarks, click here. *** I rise today again to discuss the matter of religious liberty. In particular, I would like to continue to urge this body to respect our Constitutional values and avoid any hint of applying religious tests to those who heed the call of government service. Freedom of religion is as foundational a principle as we have in this country, yet some in this chamber want to take a cabined view of it: If you’re a judicial nominee, it’s fine to attend the occasional worship service, but don’t let on that you take it too seriously. That is unacceptable. From the inception of our republic, religious believers have chosen to serve their country in countless ways. Whether through the armed forces, holding elected office, or sitting on the courts, Americans of faith have always answered the call. We should welcome this service. And we should not sit idly by while others question the propriety of their service by suggesting a de facto religious test. The Framers of the Constitution were fearful of this very thinking. They understood the importance of religious participation and foresaw the benefits religious believers of all backgrounds would contribute to the common good. They also knew from centuries of war and suffering in Europe the high costs of religious intolerance. That’s why they made it clear in Article VI of the Constitution that no public officers could be subject to a “religious test.” This edict is entirely unambiguous in its language and intent. This country is to be served by people of all faiths, committed to the Constitution and the common good. It is up to us to question the qualifications and jurisprudence of nominees, not their religious views. Unfortunately, that is not what is happening to Professor Barrett. I was at her confirmation hearing, where she faced inappropriate questions and objections based on her religious views. I witnessed a citizen heeding the call to serve her country, face inquiries into her religious beliefs that bordered on ridicule. My friends on the other side of the aisle defend their questions and their conduct, and I don’t doubt their sincerity. But there is little comfort in the defense that it doesn’t matter that Professor Barrett is a Catholic--but somehow it matters what sort of Catholic Professor Barrett is. These are unconstitutional distinctions without differences. In addition, otherwise-respectable news outlets have provided sensational reports of Professor Barrett’s personal charismatic religious practices. As a member of the United States Senate, I find this troubling. As a person of faith, I find this objectionable. And, above all, as an American, I find this abhorrent. It is religious liberty – enshrined in constitutional provisions like Article Six and the First Amendment – that has allowed my faith and so many others to flourish in the United States. And it is religious liberty that is threatened when we seek to evaluate the fitness of nominees for high office based on religious orthodoxy. I have endeavored to be consistent on this issue during time in public service. When the presidential nominee of my Party, the Party of Lincoln, called for a “Muslim ban” it was wrong. That’s not what we stand for. When a judge expressed his personal belief that a practicing Muslim shouldn’t be a member of Congress because of his religious faith, it was wrong. That this same judge is now my party’s nominee for the Senate from Alabama should concern us all. Religious tests should have no place in the Senate. Standing up for people of faith, whether Muslim or Catholic, who are facing unfair prejudice should be an act of basic conscience. It should be expected of all of us, regardless of party. It is no better for Democrats to evaluate a judicial nominee based on how many books are in the Bible on which she swears her oath, than it is for Republicans to judge a congressman for the Quran on which he does the same. To suggest that somehow a Roman Catholic judge would disregard the Constitution in favor of Church doctrine—when she has emphatically and repeatedly said she would not—is as wrong as suggesting that a Muslim judge would be somehow be forced to follow sharia law over the Constitution. Religious liberty must not depend on the religion in question. So I ask, in light of these circumstances – who will stand today against all cases of religious bigotry? Are there true liberals here who will stand up for the liberal values of religious tolerance? Some, like Professors Larry Tribe, Noah Feldman, and Chris Eisgruber. They have said, “enough.” Who here will join them? This very body is made up of individuals of near 15 different faiths. Each of us has sworn an oath to the Constitution. Each of us feel we can competently carry out our duties, as do those in the judicial branch who swear a similar oath to uphold the constitution. Mr. President, let us stand together today and without equivocation say “no” to religious intolerance in all its forms by examining the jurisprudential views and professional qualifications of the judicial nominees – not their relationships with the Almighty."

Rand Paul’s (R-Ky.) filibuster against CIA director nominee John Brennan — launched as a protest against the administration’s drone policy, which Brennan has steered for the past four years — uncovered a hunger for a broader conversation on the topic. So what does the drone program actually entail, and why are Paul and others criticizing it? What is a drone? Technically called “unmanned aerial vehicles” (UAVs), drones are just aircraft without human pilots onboard, encompassing everything from reconnaissance vehicles to unmanned crop dusters. In common parlance, though, “drone” has come to refer to unmanned combat aerial vehicles (UCAVs), which are UAVs equipped with combat capabilities, most commonly the ability to launch missiles. How long has the U.S. government been using them? The General Atomics MQ-1 Predator, the most famous UCAV in the U.S. arsenal, first saw combat in 1995 as part of the NATO intervention in Bosnia, but at that time was solely a reconnaissance tool and carried no payload. On Feb. 16, 2001, the Predator #3034 became the first to be successfully fitted with a Hellfire missile, and to fire it in a trial flight. Predators were deployed to Afghanistan almost immediately after the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, and on Oct. 7, 2001 they conducted their first armed mission there. In addition to the Predator, the General Atomics MQ-9 Reaper, a larger UCAV capable of carrying a higher payload, has seen service starting in 2007. The current program is jointly administered by the CIA and the Joint Special Operation Command (JSOC). Where do we send them? Primarily Pakistan, Yemen and Somalia. According to a Washington Post database, compiled with the help of the New America Foundation and Long War Journal, strikes in Pakistan have been occurring since 2004 and picked up in pace starting in summer 2008. Apart from a November 2002 strike in Yemen, the Somalia and Yemen campaigns began in 2011. There have been reports of strikes in the Philippines, though information there is sketchy. Additionally, drones have seen service in Libya, Afghanistan and Iraq as part of the Unites States’s more traditional military campaigns in those countries. How powerful is a drone attack? Predator drones can carry up to two Hellfire missiles. Those have warheads of about 20 pounds, which are designed to pierce tank armor; their damage outside of the vehicle targeted is limited. An alternative warhead, which manufacturer Lockheed Martin touts as featuring “high lethality and minimum collateral damage,” also is in service. Reapers are another story. They feature a maximum payload of 3,000 pounds, or 1.5 tons. That means they can carry a combination of Hellfires and larger 500 pound bombs like the GBU-12 Paveway II and GBD-38 JDAM. Those have an “effective casualty radius” of about 200 feet. That means that about 50 percent of people within 200 feet of the blast site will die. Those odds improve — or worsen, depending on how you look at it — the closer you get, obviously. So imagine if you took a football field and shrunk it by a third. A Reaper attacks one endzone with a GBU-12. If you’re on the field, you have a 50 percent chance of dying. Update: I apparently forgot the distinction between yards and feet since middle school. Corrected. How many drone attacks have we launched to date? According to the Post database, there have been 347 in Pakistan, 53 in Yemen and 2 in Somalia. From 2008 through October 2012, there were 1,015 strikes in Afghanistan, 48 in Iraq, and at least 105 in Libya according to the Bureau for Investigative Journalism. That does not include strikes in Libya past September 2011, strikes from 2001 to 2007 in Iraq and Afghanistan, and those since October 2012. The New York Times’ Mark Mazzetti reported that at least one strike has happened in the Philippines. What sort of people have we targeted? Primarily al-Qaeda and its affiliates. That includes al-Shaabab in Somalia, al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (which works in Yemen), and the Haqqani Network in Afghanistan and Pakistan. The Philippines strike was intended to kill Umar Patek, a leader of the Indonesian terrorist group Jemaah Islamiyah who helped orchestrate the 2002 attacks in Bali that killed 95 people. Patek is now serving a 20-year sentence in Indonesia. Have we killed U.S. citizens this way? We’ve killed four, at least. Anwar al-Awlaki, an American-born al-Qaeda operative in Yemen, was killed in a drone strike in 2011, as was his American-born 17-year-old son (in a subsequent strike) and Samir Khan, a North Carolina native who died in the same strike as the elder al-Alaki. Ahmed Hijazi, also an American citizen based in Yemen, was killed in 2002. Note: paragraph updated to correct spelling of al-Awlaki’s name and include Hijazi. To clarify the Obama administration’s exact policy on killing Americans without a trial, Eric Holder wrote the following letter to Sen. Rand Paul: “Dear Senator Paul: It has come to my attention that you have now asked an additional question: ‘Does the President have the authority to use a weaponized drone to kill an American not engaged in combat on American soil?’ The answer to that question is no.” The dispatch followed an earlier, more equivocal note from Holder on the subject, which seemed to indicate Holder believes the president has the authority to kill U.S. citizens on U.S. soil if he judges them a threat. How many people have died in drone attacks? Sen. Lindsey Graham estimated the death toll of the Pakistan/Somalia/Yemen program at 4,700. That’s higher than most estimates; Micah Zenko of the Council on Foreign Relations puts the number at closer to 3,500. How many of those were civilians? Cora Currier at ProPublica helpfully compiled a number of estimates in January. New America puts the civilian death total in Pakistan and Yemen between 276 and 368, of which 118-135 were under the Bush administration. The Bureau of Investigative Journalism puts the number between 446 and 978, increasing to 993 if you include Somalia. Of those, 179 to 209 were children, BIJ estimates. A Stanford/NYU study suggests that the strikes have inflicted considerable psychological trauma on residents of Pakistan, and deterred relief workers from serving areas targeted. Funerals and rescue workers have been targeted in past strikes. What’s the process for deciding when and where to launch them? As my colleague Greg Miller has reported, the administration uses something called the “disposition matrix” to determine targets for drone strikes. Miller describes it as a “single, continually evolving database in which biographies, locations, known associates and affiliated organizations are all cataloged. So are strategies for taking targets down, including extradition requests, capture operations and drone patrols…The database is meant to map out contingencies, creating an operational menu that spells out each agency’s role in case a suspect surfaces in an unexpected spot.” The National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC) will prepare lists of potential targets, which will be reviewed every three months by a panel of intelligence analysts and military officials. They are then passed along to a panel at the National Security Council, currently helmed by CIA director nominee Brennan, and then to Obama for final approval. The criteria for addition to the list are determined personally by Obama, who also must personally approve all strikes outside Pakistan. Pakistan strikes are approved by the CIA director. What’s the case for using drones? There’s some political science to suggest that “decapitation strikes,” like these drone attacks, are actually quite effective at reducing the ability of terrorist groups to operate effectively. The RAND Corporation’s Patrick Johnston and UCLA’s Anoop Sarbahi have found preliminary evidence that the drone program specifically is effective at degrading the operations of targeted groups. Zack Beauchamp has a good overview of this literature here. But that’s a case for strikes, not for drone strikes specifically. There is, however, substantial evidence that the percentage of casualties borne by civilians is much lower with drone strikes than with just about any other kind of military intervention, even if one accepts high estimates of the percent of killed who are civilians. Is Congress kept in the loop? To some degree. As part of Brennan’s confirmation process, Senate Intelligence Committee members were granted access to Justice Department memos justifying the use of drones, and a similar white paper was shared last year. The Committee and its House counterpart are also allowed to review individual strikes, including the intelligence behind them and video obtained during their commission. But they have not tried to limit the program in any way. ”I don’t know that we’ve ever seen anything that we thought was inappropriate,” one Congressional aide told the Los Angeles Times. How about the courts? Nope. Sen. Angus King (I-Maine) has proposed establishing a specialized court to approve drone strikes based on FISA courts that approve surveillance of suspected foreign intelligence in the U.S., but that is, for now, just an idea. Neal Katyal, a former acting solicitor general under Obama, has called for an oversight board placed within the executive branch. Is this legal? The Justice Department certainly thinks so, though the reasons why are classified, and lawsuits to expose them have proven unsuccessful. The clearest window we’ve gotten into their reasoning as relates to the killing of U.S. citizenscomes from a white paper leaked to NBC News last month. It derives the authority for the strikes from the Authorization for the Use of Military Force (AUMF) passed in the wake of 9/11, which grants the government broad powers against al-Qaeda. What’s more, the white paper argues that drone strikes somehow don’t run afoul of Executive Order 12333, the ban on assassinations as a tool of policy that has existed since the Ford administration, as they are used for “self-defense.” See also Brennan’s speech here defending the program more broadly. Administration critics aren’t impressed, with the ACLU’s Jameel Jaffeer noting the white paper, “argues that the government has the right to carry out the extrajudicial killing of an American citizen.” Does it violate international law? The Justice Department memo cites the UN Charter, which allows states to make war in the interest of self-defense, an interest also invoked by Brennan. Critics, like UN special rapporteur on extrajudicial killings, summary or arbitrary executions Christof Heyns, say that this defense is a stretch, and the killings plainly run afoul of the laws of war and international human rights treaties. Are other countries using drones this way? Only the United States and the United Kingdom (which assists in the Pakistan drone effort) currently use drones in combat, but many other countries have acquired drone technology, including China, Russia, India, Iran and Israel. The U.K. uses Reapers and Predators while most other countries use the Israeli Aerospace Industries Heron or similar Israeli models. Drones saw combat use in Israel during the Gaza war of late 2008. Even Hezbollah has acquired reconnaissance drones. All told, the GAO estimates that 76 countries, at least, have drone technology. What do our allies think about it? European allies other than Britain generally refrain from using drones to attack al-Qaeda, but frequently share intelligence that assists the drone program in selecting targets. What about the countries where we send drones? What do they think? They’re very mad. The Pakistani government has condemned the drone strikes as a violation of sovereignty, though there’s evidence they’re tacitly allowing the strikes to happen. The Yemeni government quietly agreed to the strikes, though murmurs of opposition have emerged of late. Citizens in both countries deplore the campaigns. Is it actually weakening al-Qaeda? New America estimates that 1,967 – 3,236 militants were killed in Pakistan and Yemen, meaning the overwhelming majority of casualties were intended targets. That said, the share of deaths who were “high-profile targets” was 11 percent under Obama and 33 percent under Bush according to New America. And there are deeper doubts as to whether the strategy is recruiting more militants than it kills, by turning local populations against the United States. The attempted Times Square bomber, for instance, cited drones as a motivating force. It could also be a bad idea even if it is weakening al-Qaeda. Many have noted that the money spent on anti-terrorism efforts might save more lives if devoted to tackling more mundane threats, like auto accidents. Thanks to Zack Beauchamp for research help throughout."
68,politifact9802,0,http://time.com/3111474/rand-paul-ferguson-police/,Rand Paul: We Must Demilitarize the Police,"The shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown is an awful tragedy that continues to send shockwaves through the community of Ferguson, Missouri and across the nation. If I had been told to get out of the street as a teenager, there would have been a distinct possibility that I might have smarted off. But, I wouldn’t have expected to be shot. The outrage in Ferguson is understandable—though there is never an excuse for rioting or looting. There is a legitimate role for the police to keep the peace, but there should be a difference between a police response and a military response. The images and scenes we continue to see in Ferguson resemble war more than traditional police action. Glenn Reynolds, in Popular Mechanics, recognized the increasing militarization of the police five years ago. In 2009 he wrote: Soldiers and police are supposed to be different. … Police look inward. They’re supposed to protect their fellow citizens from criminals, and to maintain order with a minimum of force. It’s the difference between Audie Murphy and Andy Griffith. But nowadays, police are looking, and acting, more like soldiers than cops, with bad consequences. And those who suffer the consequences are usually innocent civilians. The Cato Institute’s Walter Olson observed this week how the rising militarization of law enforcement is currently playing out in Ferguson: Why armored vehicles in a Midwestern inner suburb? Why would cops wear camouflage gear against a terrain patterned by convenience stores and beauty parlors? Why are the authorities in Ferguson, Mo. so given to quasi-martial crowd control methods (such as bans on walking on the street) and, per the reporting of Riverfront Times, the firing of tear gas at people in their own yards? (“‘This my property!’ he shouted, prompting police to fire a tear gas canister directly at his face.”) Why would someone identifying himself as an 82nd Airborne Army veteran, observing the Ferguson police scene, comment that “We rolled lighter than that in an actual warzone”? Olson added, “the dominant visual aspect of the story, however, has been the sight of overpowering police forces confronting unarmed protesters who are seen waving signs or just their hands.” How did this happen? Most police officers are good cops and good people. It is an unquestionably difficult job, especially in the current circumstances. There is a systemic problem with today’s law enforcement. Not surprisingly, big government has been at the heart of the problem. Washington has incentivized the militarization of local police precincts by using federal dollars to help municipal governments build what are essentially small armies—where police departments compete to acquire military gear that goes far beyond what most of Americans think of as law enforcement. This is usually done in the name of fighting the war on drugs or terrorism. The Heritage Foundation’s Evan Bernick wrote in 2013 that, “the Department of Homeland Security has handed out anti-terrorism grants to cities and towns across the country, enabling them to buy armored vehicles, guns, armor, aircraft, and other equipment.” Bernick continued, “federal agencies of all stripes, as well as local police departments in towns with populations less than 14,000, come equipped with SWAT teams and heavy artillery.” Bernick noted the cartoonish imbalance between the equipment some police departments possess and the constituents they serve, “today, Bossier Parish, Louisiana, has a .50 caliber gun mounted on an armored vehicle. The Pentagon gives away millions of pieces of military equipment to police departments across the country—tanks included.” When you couple this militarization of law enforcement with an erosion of civil liberties and due process that allows the police to become judge and jury—national security letters, no-knock searches, broad general warrants, pre-conviction forfeiture—we begin to have a very serious problem on our hands. Given these developments, it is almost impossible for many Americans not to feel like their government is targeting them. Given the racial disparities in our criminal justice system, it is impossible for African-Americans not to feel like their government is particularly targeting them. This is part of the anguish we are seeing in the tragic events outside of St. Louis, Missouri. It is what the citizens of Ferguson feel when there is an unfortunate and heartbreaking shooting like the incident with Michael Brown. Anyone who thinks that race does not still, even if inadvertently, skew the application of criminal justice in this country is just not paying close enough attention. Our prisons are full of black and brown men and women who are serving inappropriately long and harsh sentences for non-violent mistakes in their youth. The militarization of our law enforcement is due to an unprecedented expansion of government power in this realm. It is one thing for federal officials to work in conjunction with local authorities to reduce or solve crime. It is quite another for them to subsidize it. Americans must never sacrifice their liberty for an illusive and dangerous, or false, security. This has been a cause I have championed for years, and one that is at a near-crisis point in our country. Let us continue to pray for Michael Brown’s family, the people of Ferguson, police, and citizens alike. Paul is the junior U.S. Senator for Kentucky. Sign up for Inside TIME.

Despite his erratically shifting views and odd phases, he continually returns to this core political refrain: He talks about using government in energetic but limited ways to increase growth, dynamism and social mobility. As he said in 2007, “It’s not a point of view libertarians would embrace, but I am more in the Alexander Hamilton-Teddy Roosevelt tradition of conservatism. I recognize that there are times when you need government to help spur private enterprise and economic development.” Look at American history, Gingrich continued, “The government provided railroad land grants to encourage widespread adoption of what was then the most modern form of transportation to develop our country. The Homestead Act essentially gave away land to those willing to live on it and develop it. We used what were in effect public-private partnerships to bring telephone service and electricity to every community in our nation. All of these are examples of government bringing about public purposes without creating massive taxpayer-funded bureaucracies.” This was not one of Gingrich’s passing fads. It is one of the most consistent themes of his career. His 1984 book, “Window of Opportunity,” is a broadside against what he calls the “laissez-faire” conservatism — the idea that government should just get out of the way so the market can flourish. As he wrote, “The opportunity society calls not for a laissez-faire society in which the economic world is a neutral jungle of purely random individual behavior, but for forceful government intervention on behalf of growth and opportunity.”"

""We know it can be done safely,"" said Hood, who is Special Advisor for Energy Policy to Teamsters General President James P. Hoffa. Hood is also Secretary-Treasurer of Local 959 in Anchorage. Hood noted that 58 percent of the petroleum used by the United States is imported, and that figure will jump to 70 percent by 2010. Hood said the imported oil arrives in largely unsafe, single-hull oil tankers. Hood recalled the 1989 Exxon Valdez tragedy in Alaska. ""We never want to see that again,"" Hood said.

""It's time for America to have what it has lacked for too long: a responsible, realistic energy plan that meets our needs and protects our future."""

World leaders who attended the king's funeral on Sunday used the occasion for an intensive round of meetings centred on pushing forward the Middle East peace process.
President Clinton, the Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and the Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat met for three-way discussions that American officials said were brief but animated.
Palestinian officials said Mr Arafat and Mr Barak will meet again on Tuesday to discuss Israeli implementation of existing peace accords.
UK Foreign Secretary Robin Cook had meetings with the Israeli, Palestinian and Egyptian leaders.
""The talks demonstrated all players' hope, enthusiasm and commitment for the peace process, while all recognised that there were serious negotiations to come,"" a Foreign Office spokesman said.
Contrary to Israeli predictions, there was no encounter between Mr Barak and the Syrian President, Hafez al-Assad, because Mr Assad stayed at home.
Landmark meetings
There were other diplomatic landmarks. The new President of Algeria, Abdelaziz Bouteflika, shook hands with Mr Barak - a first for a country officially still at war with Israel.
Mr Barak's security adviser Danny Yatom told Israeli television the meeting was a ""friendly and moving encounter.""
Another key player in the Middle East peace process, the Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, had a series of meetings at the funeral, including one with Mr Barak.
President Bouteflika, for his part, took the opportunity to hold talks with Morocco's new King Muhammad after the funeral - moving swiftly to improve relations between the two countries, officials said.
The Algerian leader was accompanied by a high-level delegation, including his Prime Minister Smail Hamdani, underlining the importance he attached to the occasion.
US President Clinton stayed in Rabat well after nightfall, to meet various leaders from the Middle East, Africa and Europe.
But by Monday, most of the presidents, prime ministers and kings had left Morocco, leaving behind pledges of support for the new king.
Frenzied scenes
King Hassan died of a heart attack on Friday. He was the Arab world's longest-serving head of state.
In all, representatives of more than 50 countries came to pay their final respects to the king.
There were frenzied scenes of mourning by some of the 2m people estimated to have come to catch a glimpse of the king's coffin.
The Muslim tradition, which says that burial should take place within 24 hours of death, was waived to allow so many foreign guests to attend.
Government sources said on Sunday that King Muhammad VI, as he will be styled, got married in a quiet ceremony on the day his father died.
""According to Moroccan tradition, the crown prince must be married so that he can ascend the throne,"" a source told the Reuters news agency.
Other reports said the Palace denied the wedding took place.

74,snopes10,0,http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/gop-cave-on-obamacare-repeal-is-the-biggest-broken-promise-in-political-history/article/2618413,GOP cave on Obamacare repeal is the biggest broken promise in political history,"Broken promises are as old as politics itself, and there are many famous examples of them in modern history. President George H.W. Bush's ""read my lips, no new taxes"" pledge comes immediately to mind, as does President Bill Clinton reneging on his middle-class tax cut, and President Barack Obama never closing Guantanamo Bay. But in each of those cases, those were promises that were made in a given campaign by a given politician. The promise of Obamacare repeal is much different.

Republicans ran on repealing and replacing Obamacare for seven years, over the course of four election cycles. They won the House majority in 2010 in large part because of the backlash against the passage of Obamacare  and the vow to ""repeal and replace"" Obamacare was part of their ""Pledge to America"" campaign document that year. The botched rollout of Obamacare helped them win the Senate in 2014. House candidates, Senate candidates, gubernatorial candidates, and even state legislative candidates ran against Obamacare  and won.

Though President Trump was always an unorthodox candidate on healthcare (vacillating between praising single-payer and touting a free market plan), he consistently campaigned on repealing and replacing Obamacare, and exploited news of spiking premiums in the weeks leading up to the presidential election.

Republicans were always moving the goal posts on voters. That is, during campaign season, they made boasts about repeal, and then once in office, they talked about procedural complications. In 2010, they campaigned on repeal, but by 2011, they said they needed the Senate. In 2014, they won the Senate, but by 2015 they said as long as Obama was in office, nothing would become law. In 2016, they told conservative voters, even reluctant ones, that if they voted for Trump despite any reservations, they'd finally be able to repeal Obamacare. In November, voters gave them unified control of Washington. And yet after just two months on the job, they have thrown in the towel and said they're willing to abandon seven years of promises.

There are a lot of people who want to conveniently lay the blame for this stunning failure on recalcitrant members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus. If only these conservative hardliners were willing to give way, we'd be on the road to repeal, defenders of leadership would like to have us believe. This is convenient, both because there are always people in Washington eager to take aim at conservative purists, and also because it has the makings of a great ironic hot take for journalists: ""How conservatives saved Obamacare.""

Now, let me be clear, in past fights, I've never been reluctant to criticize hardliners when I thought that they were being unreasonable or irresponsible. For instance, I disagreed with the hard-line position on the debt ceiling, didn't think forcing a government shutdown to defund Obamacare would work, and supported the deal that made most of the Bush tax cuts permanent (as opposed to letting them all expire). But I don't think it's fair to scapegoat Freedom Caucusers here. They are being blamed for making the naive mistake of assuming that Republicans wanted to do what they were promising to do for seven years.

In this case, the hardliners were playing a productive role by pointing out the real policy consequences of the piecemeal approach being pursued by the House leadership. Though we'll never know for sure how the numbers might have looked if a vote had taken place, it's clear that many centrist members of the Republican caucus were also prepared to vote this bill down. House conservatives, if they could be blamed for anything, it's for having the audacity to urge leadership to actually honor seven years of pledges to voters to repeal Obamacare. If anybody was moving the goal posts, it wasn't Freedom Caucusers, it was those who were trying to sell a bill that kept much of Obamacare's regulatory architecture in place as a free market repeal and replace plan.

Sure, I know, Republicans had a narrow majority, and they could only pass something through the Senate by reconciliation, which imposes limitations. But the thing is, Republicans don't hide behind the vagaries of Senate procedure during campaign season. Trump did not win the Republican nomination telling rallies of thousands of people, ""We're going to repeal and replace Obamacare  as long as it satisfies the Byrd rule in the judgment of the Senate parliamentarian!""

What's so utterly disgraceful, is not just that Republicans failed so miserably, but that they barely tried, raising questions about whether they ever actually wanted to repeal Obamacare in the first place.

Republicans for years have criticized the process that produced Obamacare, and things certainly got ugly. But after having just witnessed this debacle, I think Paul Ryan owes Nancy Pelosi an apology.

One has to admire the commitment that Democrats and Obama had to delivering something they campaigned on and truly believed in. They spent 13 months getting the bill from an initial concept to final passage, and pressed on during many points when everybody was predicting doom. They had public hearings, multiple drafts of different bills, they kept negotiating, even worked into Christmas. They made significant changes at times, but also never lost sight of their key goals. They didn't back down in the face of angry town halls and after losing their filibuster-proof majority, and many members cast votes that they knew risked their political careers. Obama himself was a leader, who consistently made it clear that he was not going to walk away. He did countless rallies, meetings, speeches  even a ""summit"" at the Blair House  to try to sell the bill, talking about details, responding to criticisms of the bill to the point that he was mocked by conservatives for talking so much about healthcare.

The contrast between Obama and Democrats on healthcare and what just happened is stunning. House Republicans slapped together a bill in a few weeks (months if we're being generous) behind closed doors with barely any debate. They moved the bill through committees at blazing speed, conducted closed-door negotiations that resulted in relatively minor tweaks to the bill, and within 17 days, Trump decided that he'd had enough, and was ready to walk away if members didn't accept the bill as is. It reminded me of the scene in ""Duck Soup,"" in which Groucho Marx portrays Rufus T. Firefly, leader of the fictional Freedonia. Firefly conducts a cabinet meeting that he starts by saying he'll take up old business. One official says, ""I wish to discuss the tariff."" Firefly responds, ""Sit down, that's new business."" When nobody has any old business to discuss he decides to turn to new business. ""About that tariff "" the same official interjects. ""Too late,"" Firefly responds, ""That's old business already.""

This is not too far off from the process we just witnessed. Healthcare is incredibly complicated stuff, with each provision of legislation being interconnected with others. It can't be negotiated like a spending bill in which two people have a different spending target, and somehow you manage to split the difference. We know what the market is like under Obamacare and have a decent idea of what it would be like if it were repealed. But the random, piecemeal combination of changes being made to win over votes, presents everybody with completely new policy challenges that experts were scrambling to assess in real time, yet lawmakers were being asked to vote on them within hours of being adopted. And House Freedom Caucus members are the ones who don't understand how serious governing works? Give me a break.

Here's the bottom line: Republicans didn't want to repeal Obamacare that badly. Obamacare was a useful tool for them. For years, they could use it to score short-term messaging victories. People are steamed about high premiums? We'll message on that today. People are angry about losing insurance coverage? We'll put out a devastating YouTube video about that. Seniors are angry about the Medicare cuts? Let's tweet about it. High deductibles are unpopular? We'll issue an email fact sheet. Or maybe a gif. At no point were they willing to do the hard work of hashing out their intraparty policy differences and developing a coherent health agenda or of challenging the central liberal case for universal coverage. Sure, if the U.S. Supreme Court did the job for them, they were okay with Obamacare going away. But when push came to shove, they weren't willing to put in the elbow grease.

There was a big debate over the course of the election about how out of step Trump was with the Republican Party on many issues. But if anything, this episode shows that Trump and the GOP are perfect together  limited in attention span, all about big talk and identity politics, but uninterested in substance.

Failing to get the votes on one particular bill is one thing. But failing and then walking away on seven years of promises is a pathetic abdication of duty. The Republican Party is a party without a purpose."
75,snopes100,0,https://www.cleveland.com/browns/2016/07/browns_isaiah_crowell_i_was_ve.html,Browns' Isaiah Crowell: 'I was very wrong in posting that image',"CLEVELAND, Ohio -- Browns running back Isaiah Crowell learned a hard lesson after posting a graphic depiction of a police officer being stabbed in the neck by a hooded man in the aftermath of two black men being fatally shot by officers last week.

Crowell, the Browns' starting tailback, quickly deleted the post, which went up Wednesday afternoon on his Instagram account. But now, some fans are outraged and calling for the Browns to cut him.


The Browns are not believed to have any plans to do so. They believe that Crowell made a grave mistake, quickly deleted the post and has shown tremendous remorse.

Likewise, the NFL seems satisfied with Crowell's actions since the errant post.

""The image was inappropriate and insensitive,'' NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy said in an email response. ""He realized this, took down the post and has since apologized.''

The post was in response to the two black men being killed by white police officers, Philando Castile in Minnesota and Alton Sterling in Louisiana, and was made when emotions were running high. It also went up a day before the fatal shootings of five police officers in Dallas and was not in response to the ambush.

On Monday, Crowell issued the following apology through the club and on his Twitter account:

""Last week was an emotional and difficult week as we saw extreme acts of violence against black men across our country as well as against police officers in Dallas,'' he wrote. ""I posted an image to Instagram in the midst of that emotion that I shouldn't have and immediately removed it. It was an extremely poor decision and I apologize for that mistake and for offending people.


""My values and beliefs do not match that image. I am outraged and upset by the deaths of Alton Sterling and Philando Castile along with so many others.  I am also outraged and saddened by the attacks in Dallas and the deaths of the five honorable police officers (Lorne Ahrens, Michael Krol, Michael J. Smith, Brent Thompson and Patrick Zamarripa) who were providing protection while trying to keep peace.


Isaiah Crowell quickly deleted this offensive drawing.


""We have to be better as a society, it's not about color, it's about what's right and wrong. I was very wrong in posting that image. Every single life matters, every death as a result of violence should be treated with equal outrage and penalty.''

In the illustration posted by Crowell, the officer is being stabbed in the neck by a person in a black jacket and hood, with his face covered. He has an ankh pendant around his neck, which was an ancient Egyptian character that represented the concept of eternal life. He's also wearing black gloves and an American flag backpack.

Blood is spurting out of the officer's neck and mouth, which is covered by the murderer's hand.

Crowell's caption read, ""They give police all types of weapons and they continually choose to kill us....#Weak.""

The post, which received 33 likes, was taken down after about a minute, but was screen-shotted and circulated on social media.

Crowell, expected to get the bulk of the carries this season, led the Browns with 706 yards on 185 carries, including four touchdowns.  He also caught 19 passes for 182 yards with one touchdown.


Crowell was signed by the Browns as an undrafted free agent out of Alabama State in 2014.

Browns coach Hue Jackson was so impressed with Crowell and his counterpart Duke Johnson this offseason that he passed up an opportunity to draft a running back with his 14 picks.

""I really think Isaiah Crowell is a really good running back,'' Jackson said in May. ""I think he's going to have a sensational season, I really do. Obviously Isaiah is very explosive,"" he said. ""He's got quick feet, he's fast in the hole, he runs with good pad level.''

Based on his apology, Crowell hopes to leave the Instagram controversy in his wake."

Flag-waving demonstrators from the National Front and the right-wing South East Alliance marched through the seaside town to protest against the arrival of immigrants.

They clashed with anti-racism activists including the Kent Anti-Racism Network, who organised a counter-demonstration.

Kent Police described the protest as a ""fast-moving and ongoing incident"" but were unable to say whether there had been any arrests.

Several roads were closed in the area and police said 'stop and search' tactics were used 'to ensure a peaceful protest'.

After the march the National Front posted on its Facebook site, saying: ""A big well done and thank you to all white nationalists who attended Dover today to save our country from invasion. Respect to all in attendance.""

Earlier, Maidstone services on the M20 were closed after several coaches believed to be taking people to the protest were damaged.

Police were called to a disturbance at the services shortly before 11am, where two coaches had swastikas painted on them in blood.

One had its windscreen smashed as rival groups clashed.

Kent Police said one man was arrested on suspicion of possessing an offensive weapon, and another coach that left the scene was stopped by officers at junction 11 services at Westenhanger."
77,snopes102,0,https://www.startribune.com/anti-racism-protesters-block-streets-and-light-rail-in-minneapolis/440418643/,"Minneapolis anti-racism rally draws hundreds, blocks streets","Solidarity march brought together multiple groups to march along Franklin Avenue to downtown. A crowd of at least 1,000 gathered Monday evening in Minneapolis to decry the Nazi-flag-waving white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Va., and to stand in solidarity with counterdemonstrators there.

By 5 p.m., the group packed the 2200 block of Franklin Avenue E., outside the headquarters of the Republican Party of Minnesota. They carried signs, chanted slogans and embraced one another — black and white, young and old, Christian, Jewish and Muslim — and were roused by activists from the Anti-War Committee, Students for a Democratic Society, New North, the Minnesota Immigrant Rights Action Committee and other groups.

Speakers invoked the memories of Heather Heyer, the Virginia woman who was killed Saturday when a car sped into the crowd of counterprotesters in Charlottesville; the bombing at the Dar Al Farooq Islamic Center in Bloomington a week ago, and the deaths of Jamar Clark and Philando Castile at the hands of Twin Cities police officers.

Sally Lieberman of Minneapolis carried a sign that read, “Daughter of WWII vet, mother of Jews. I will not rest while even one Nazi walks this land.” On the other side, it read, “In Trump’s Amerikkka, loving your neighbor makes you part of a ‘fringe’ group.”

Lieberman said she’s been to other rallies and marches to support Black Lives Matter and immigrant rights.

“I argued with my dad, who said the Civil War was not over,” she said. “I said it’s over. There’s still racism, but it’s over.

“He was right,” she said. “I was proven wrong.”

Ryan Vernosh and Sara Gramer of White Bear Lake brought their two daughters, ages 6½ and 9, to the rally.

“It’s important we all stand united against white supremacy,” Vernosh said. “It’s important that especially white people come out in droves and say we aren’t going to support that kind of bigotry.”

Although inconvenienced, many drivers trying to make their way through the area honked in support.

Samantha Pree-Stinson, who identified herself as a human rights activist, told the crowd, “We have failed to acknowledge history and now we are repeating it. Free speech does not protect terrorism.”

Misty Rowan of the Anti-War Committee said, “This is not surprising to anyone who’s been paying attention. You know we have a race problem, and it starts right at the top.”

The crowd stayed at 500 to 700 people as it moved along Franklin and down Cedar Avenue. Some shopkeepers came out with fists raised in support and flashed peace signs as the marchers chanted.

A 9-year-old girl wearing a hijab and holding her father’s hand was overheard telling him, “I miss Obama. We wouldn’t be going through this commotion.”

The group was escorted front and back by police squads with lights flashing. Police, State Patrol and group marshals held cars at freeway entrances and exit ramps until the crowd passed.

The marchers stretched two blocks long as they headed west on Washington Avenue into downtown Minneapolis. Hotel and restaurant guests along the route headed outside or pasted themselves to the windows with cellphone cameras in hand.

Heading north on 4th Avenue S., the group ended at the Hennepin County jail. A few in the group blocked the light-rail tracks, forcing a train to reverse back to the Government Center station. An effigy in khaki pants and a white shirt was burned on the jail plaza but went out as firefighters arrived.

Minneapolis and Metro Transit police looked on but took no action.

After 2½ hours, organizers urged the crowd to leave in groups and watch out for each others’ safety.

Similarly themed rallies and marches occurred Monday in other states. Protesters in Durham, N.C., toppled a long-standing statue of a Confederate soldier as dozens cheered and chanted.

Several hundred people marched through the streets of an Ohio city where the man accused of running down protesters in Virginia had been living.

The anti-racism rally Monday in Maumee took place just a few miles from where James Alex Fields Jr. lived the past year.
Fields is in jail in Virginia, where he’s accused of ramming his car into counterprotesters at a white nationalist rally Saturday, killing Heyer and injuring 19.

At the Monday march in Ohio, Chris Thomas of Sylvania said residents need to stand up and say that Fields doesn’t represent their community."
78,snopes103,0,https://money.cnn.com/2017/08/14/media/jim-acosta-donald-trump-press-conference/index.html,President Trump promised a 'big press conference.' Here's what happened.,"President Trump evidently doesn't know the definition of ""press conference.""
Last Friday, after two days of unusual engagement with the White House press corps, Trump promised to hold a ""pretty big press conference"" at the White House on Monday.

But the White House didn't set up any press conference. Instead, he gave a hastily-arranged speech without answering any questions.When he came before cameras a second time Monday, and CNN's Jim Acosta, who was in the room serving as pool reporter, asked about the lack of a presser, Trump said, ""We had a press conference. We just had a press conference.""

But he had not.

As Acosta pressed, asking if reporters could ask more questions, Trump turned to him and said, ""I like real news, not fake news, you are fake news.""

Acosta responded: ""Haven't you spread a lot of fake news yourself, sir?""

Trump's declaration that ""we had a press conference"" seemed to confirm what some White House correspondents already surmised -- that Trump is counting any appearance in front of the press corps as a press conference.

Journalists, historians and past presidents all agree on a different definition. A ""press conference"" is a structured, seated event where the president fields a series of questions.

""Press availabilities"" or ""Q&A sessions"" are more informal opportunities to ask questions of the president.

Trump's speeches on Monday met neither definition.

""It's not a press conference if you don't take questions from reporters,"" CNN White House reporter Kaitlan Collins said on the air after Trump claimed ""we just had a press conference.""

David Graham of The Atlantic remarked on Twitter that Trump ""says confidently that there was a press conference that didn't happen, which is some aggressive gaslighting.""

Acosta later called it a ""flat-out falsehood.""

Trump has held about a dozen relatively short joint press conferences with foreign heads of state since taking office in January. But he has not held a full-fledged solo press conference since February 16, breaking with decades of presidential precedent.

The presser drought has been getting more and more attention in recent weeks.

Some reporters thought Trump would hold a full-blown press conference before going on vacation in August, but he did not.

However, he did seem more accessible than usual while spending time at his private golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey last week.

Last Thursday and Friday Trump held a total of four press availabilities. He seemed eager to field questions from the journalists who were there.

At the fourth and final session, he said ""we're going to have a pretty big press conference on Monday"" -- which is why journalists wondered why he didn't follow through on Monday."

State officials said the driver was in custody. 

The planned rally had already been shut down following bottle-throwing clashes between alt-right demonstrators, counter-protesters, white nationalists, neo-Nazis and supporters of Black Lives Matter.Al Thomas, Charlottesville police chief, said 35 people were injured in clashes between opposing groups and in the car crash. Their injuries ranged from life-threatening to minor, he said. The driver of the car will be charged with criminal homicide, Thomas said. Albermarle County Regional Jail officials identified the suspect as 20-year-old James Alex Fields of Ohio.

Police officials said Fields would be charged with one count of second degree murder, three counts of malicious wounding and one count of hit and run. In addition, the FBI announced Saturday night it would open a civil rights investigation into the circumstances of the death.

“Our hearts break for the casualties and injuries,” Charlottesville Mayor Mike Signer said at a press conference.

About three hours after the car crash, a Virginia State Police Bell 407 helicopter crashed about 7 miles from the scene. Police reports said the helicopter crashed in a wooded area and the two pilots died. No one on the ground was injured. The helicopter had been assisting in police supervision of the protests.

Virginia State Police identified the two as Lt. Jay Cullen, 48, of Midlothian, Va. and Trooper-Pilot Berke Bates, 40, of Quinton, Va. Cullen was a 23-year veteran of the force and is survived by his wife and two sons. Bates was a three-year veteran of the force and joined the aviation unit last month.
The driver of a silver Dodge Challenger plowed into one of the groups streaming away from the rally at Emancipation Park through the narrow downtown streets. 

President Trump, on vacation at his golf club in New Jersey, condemned “in the strongest possible terms” what he called an “egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides” in Charlottesville. He called for “a swift restoration of law and order and the protection of innocent lives.”

Trump said he spoke with Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe and “we agreed that the hate and the division must stop and must stop right now.”

McAuliffe delivered a message to the white supremacists at an evening press conference: ""Go home, you are not wanted in this great commonwealth, shame on you.""

The governor declared a state of emergency shortly before 11 a.m. as the earlier protests and counter-protests turned unruly. He said he was “disgusted by the hatred, bigotry and violence” and blamed “mostly out-of-state protesters.”

The violence played out against a backdrop of unofficial, armed militia groups ringing the park, where the rally was called to protest the planned removal of a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee.

Some 500 protesters among the white nationalist and alt-right groups left the park shortly after state police, using megaphones, declared the gathering an ""unlawful assembly"" at 11:40 a.m., about 20 minutes before the rally was scheduled to begin.

Clusters of alt-right activists and counter-protesters remained, however, raising fears of more clashes. Police then put on gas masks as they stepped up efforts to disperse the crowds, which then left the park.

McAuliffe declared the state of emergency to give local authorities more resources to quell the disturbance. Officials had already deployed police to maintain order and McAuliffe had placed the Virginia National Guard on standby.

The clashes, mainly between white nationalists and anti-fascist groups, broke out as crowds moved toward the park where the Lee statue is located. At one point, dozens of people used wooden poles from their flags and banners as weapons. Others threw trash and bottles into the opposing ranks of protesters as the crowds swelled.

Numerous protesters came prepared, wearing helmets and flak jackets and charging into crowds holding plastic riot shields. Protesters on one side of a square held up anti-fascist signs and Black Lives Matter banners, while groups on the other displayed Confederate flags and iron cross banners. 

Laurel Cummings, who works at the Oakhurst Inn in Charlottesville, said people have been canceling their rooms this weekend due to concerns about safety. She has also been warning guests about avoiding the downtown area.

“I came in to work today praying that no one was going to check in with a Swastika on their arm,” she said. “I knew I would refuse to check them in. If that gets me fired, I’m OK with that.”

From his vacation home in New Jersey, Trump tweeted: ""We ALL must be united & condemn all that hate stands for. There is no place for this kind of violence in America. Lets come together as one!""
As dusk fell Saturday, Charlottesville residents described a city buried in chaos.

""There were fist fights breaking out,” said Brad Slocum, a 2012 University of Virginia graduate who attended Saturday's rally at Emancipation Park. His friends were attacked with flag poles, he said, and he left with some bruises after an attempt to de-escalate a skirmish between a protester and counter protester.

Slocum said the scene was frightening, but showing up was “the right thing to do.”

“I believe in taking direct action to stand up for what I believe is right,” Slocum said. “I consider bigotry and racial discrimination to be completely unacceptable.”

Saturday's violence followed a spontaneous march the previous night by torch-wielding protesters on the University of Virginia campus that was broken up by police as an unlawful assembly after scuffles broke out and pepper spray filled the air. 

That came after a federal court injunction rejected the city's earlier attempt to move the ""Unite the Right"" rally to another park. 

On the eve of the rally, McAuliffe, a Democrat, said he would prefer that no one shows up at the ""Unite the Right"" rally.

""I want to urge my fellow Virginians who may consider joining either in support or opposition to the planned rally to make alternative plans,"" he said.

Police chief Thomas said the unfolding events created a ""lot of anxiety"" in the community, but he felt it had sufficient resources to meet the ""significant challenge.""

City authorities were particularly alarmed by Friday night's march by hundreds of white nationalists who gathered at the feet of a statue of Thomas Jefferson on the UVa. campus, chanting ""You will not replace us.""

Fights broke out as some marchers bearing tiki torches swung them at others, the Daily Progress reported.

UVa. President Teresa Sullivan said she was ""deeply saddened and disturbed by the hateful behavior"" displayed by the marchers. 

In the past few months, white nationalist groups have paid particular attention to Charlottesville, a progressive college town where over 80% of residents voted for Hillary Clinton.

The Charlottesville City Council voted in May to sell the Lee statue, but a judge issued a temporary injunction that blocked the city from moving the statue for six months, The Daily Progress reported. 

After the vote to remove the statue, several dozen demonstrators, led by prominent white supremacist Richard Spencer, gathered at night by the Lee statue, wielding torches.

In July, Ku Klux Klan members held a rally in Charlottesville in Justice Park, where they were met with more than a thousand upset counter-protesters.

White nationalist groups continue to return to Charlottesville partly because they saw the May torch light gathering as a great success, noted Heidi Beirich, director of the Intelligence Project at the Southern Poverty Law Center.

“They loved the imagery of that. They were over the moon about that,” she said. “They viewed it as having been a wonderful recruiting tool."""
80,snopes105,0,,The Story Behind the Viral Photo of the Officer and the KKK,"The officer stands calmly as a group of white supremacists act out behind him. One man’s outstretched right arm signals a Nazi salute. Another wears a red hood. A third rests a Confederate flag on his shoulder.

The provocative scene that Saturday afternoon in Charlottesville, captured with an iPhone, was shared with a modest public following but would attract a wide audience. “Confederate flags, Nazi salutes, and Klansmen having their rights protected by a black police officer,” reads a tweet posted on Aug. 12 by Ubadah Sabbagh, a Ph.D. student at Virginia Tech. “This picture hurts.” James P. O’Neill, commissioner of the New York City Police Department, shared the image and commended law enforcement in Charlottesville “for handling today’s events with true professionalism. Much respect.” Tim Hogan, a former member of the Hillary for America communications team, tweeted it, too: “A picture worth a thousand words.” A writer, Yashar Ali, suggested the image be nominated for a Pulitzer Prize. “A black police officer protecting a group of men who wish him harm,” he wrote in a tweet. “Incredible.” He prefaced that remark with a question common during breaking news: “Who took this photo?”

And when was it taken? The picture went viral on Aug. 12, as the Virginia college town was rocked by unrest over the planned “Unite the Right” rally. Tensions that morning had devolved into street clashes, as dozens of white nationalists, neo-Nazis and Klansmen faced off against a fierce contingent of counterprotesters over plans to remove a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee from a city park. As intense pictures from the violence made the rounds, this image stood alone. A distraction in what otherwise felt like a moment of chaos.

The image spread further after a speeding car smashed into counterdemonstrators—sending bodies flying, killing one woman and injuring 19 others. But as the retweets entered into the tens of thousands, doubts emerged that this image was from Saturday’s events. In the uncomfortable haze of live breaking news it became the latest in a long line of images to be grabbed and shared online without credit or context. Social networks are minefields for information-gatherers. Photographers lose control of their work while those who share it reap the rewards: retweets, likes, followers. Images are separated from their intended meaning, and can even take on a new one.

And so began a hunt for the photographer.A reverse image search on Google pointed to Reddit, where a thread with the photo was submitted on July 15 under the headline: “Police Officer Nash protects the KKK’s first amendment rights as they protest the removal of two statues commemorating Confederate generals in Charlottesville, VA last weekend.” The entry supported suspicions the image was not from Aug. 12. Among the comments was a link to another thread, submitted four days prior, titled, “This picture was taken at the KKK rally July 8th in Charlottesville, Virginia.” Helpful, but it raised more questions than answers.

The search moved to Facebook, where Frank Somerville, an anchor with KTVU in Oakland, Calif., shared a post on July 13 by Kimberly Payne Hawk that included the picture. She had first seen the image on the Facebook page of a friend. Would she happen to know the photographer?

Reached by Facebook message, she offered a name of a local resident. A few scrolls through the Instagram feed of an account associated with the name and there the picture was, between another protest image and a photograph celebrating a soft drink.

Jill Mumie lives about a block away from Justice Park. On July 8, a scorcher of a Saturday, she ventured out to support the counterprotesters. “I knew I wanted to go and be a part of that,” she tells TIME. “I went by myself and just wanted to be part of the energy.”

Mumie, 42, had recently moved to Charlottesville from New Jersey, where she worked for five years in Philadelphia’s hospitality industry. In college she had studied art and photography and worked as a Canon EOS Tech Support representative. She was only in town for about a week and a half before the rally.

That afternoon, she positioned herself near an area that had been cordoned off “in anticipation of what might unfold.” She purposefully stayed in front of the officer, waiting for what she felt was the right moment that captured the “bizarre” scene that was unfolding.

Once the Loyal White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan arrived, she recalled “a huge surge of people behind me.” And so with her iPhone, Mumie tried a few different shots. In one outtake, a girl stands beside the officer, snapping a picture of the commotion as the officer stares elsewhere. The angle of his chin, the tilt of his head, something felt off. In another outtake, the attention is focused on a man behind the officer who displays a middle finger in Mumie’s direction.

Without much water on such a hot day, Mumie left the area soon after. At one point, the gathering of about 50 Klansmen would be deemed unlawful and authorities would forcefully break up the crowd that was angered, in part, by officers’ escort of the Klansmen back to their vehicles. Hours later, a local outlet, The Daily Progress, reported that police had arrested 23 people in connection with the protest.

Mumie later posted an image from the scene to her Instagram account (@lil_mooms)—what she calls her “sketchbook.” With a few hundred followers, it began in an eddy, but was pulled into the mainstream. This past weekend, friends alerted her that it was being shared widely. “You have this person being professional and protecting the free speech of Americans and then you have this hate speech behind him,” she says. “I remember looking at it after the fact and thought it really does sum it up.”

For Mumie, the picture is about the show of restraint and resilience. She uses words like “duty” and “honor” and invokes former First Lady Michelle Obama’s message during last year’s Democratic National Convention: “When they go low, we go high.”

Days before the Aug. 12 rally, Mumie dropped off a copy of the photograph, along with her contact information, at the local police department.

Was the officer aware of the icon he’d become?

A school resource officer at Charlottesville High School, Darius Nash, confirmed to TIME on Aug. 14 that it was he in the photograph.

“I don’t feel like I’m a hero for it,” Nash wrote in an email statement that morning. “I swore to protect my city and that’s what I was there to do. I don’t think it makes me a hero, just doing what I believe in.”

Later in the afternoon, Nash said he appreciated the show of support for law enforcement and said the experience “humbled me a whole lot, just seeing how a picture like that can reveal so much.” At one point, highlighting how much the community has been affected by the violence, Nash said a friend of his wife knew the victim of the car-ramming, Heather Heyer. “So we all felt it.”"

The man who was to receive the package outside Los Angeles has been arrested on federal charges.

Rodrigo Franco, 34, could face 20 years in prison on a charge of illegally importing merchandise, federal prosecutors said Tuesday. U.S. officials accuse him of violating the Endangered Species Act and falsifying records.

The package had been sent via the U.S. Postal Service. Each of the deadly king cobra snakes that were sent to Franco's address were about 2 feet long, according to an affidavit filed in federal court. In addition to the venomous snakes, agents found three albino Chinese soft-shelled turtles when they opened the parcel on March 2.

Agents who searched the package removed the cobras but allowed the turtles to be delivered to Franco's address the next day under controlled circumstances before carrying out a raid, the U.S. Attorney's Office said in announcing the charges.

When agents from the FWS and the Homeland Security Department executed a search warrant at Franco's home, they found that the package had been left in what looked to be a child's bedroom. There, more animals were found living in tanks, including a baby Morelet's crocodile, two types of snapping turtles and five terrapins.Franco returned home while agents were at his apartment in Monterey Park. Under questioning, he told them he had received 20 king cobras in two earlier shipments — and that they had died, prosecutors said. But analysis of records on his phone led agents to believe that at least some of those snakes had survived, because Franco had mentioned feeding them and delivering five snakes.

As for the location of those snakes, the suspect ""said that one of his contacts in China had a cousin that flew to Los Angeles from Virginia, collected the snakes, and returned to Virginia,"" the federal affidavit against Franco states, noting that the suspect had claimed the snakes were dead.

The package had initially been flagged by an agriculture specialist of Customs and Border Protection — who opened it under suspicion that it might contain drugs, based on the shipper's address. When they saw something moving, they called inspectors at the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.

The shipper's address was also recognized by Fish and Wildlife Service Special Agent Stephanie Johnson, whose portion of the affidavit mentions having an online exchange with the Hong Kong provider last year that included an offer of selling venomous snakes.

Johnson lays out the discovery in the court document:

With the king cobras intercepted, the agents had to figure out what to do with them.

According to court documents, FWS Special Agent Erin Dean had verified the snakes were king cobras by sending photographs to Ian Recchio, the reptile curator at the Los Angeles Zoo. But Recchio said he couldn't house the snakes at his zoo because it didn't have anti-venom to protect against possible bites.

Recchio told Dean ""that if someone had been bitten by one of the cobras, they likely would have died as there is not a ready source of anti-venom that he knew about in Los Angeles,"" the affidavit states, noting that the closest source, at San Diego's zoo, was too far for someone with a king cobra bite to travel.

Agents from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service say they believe Franco had been exchanging rare animals with a contact in Hong Kong for several months.

On the same day the snakes were found in a can, Franco shipped a package containing six turtles — desert box turtles, three-toed box turtles and Florida box turtles — to an address in Hong Kong. That package was also intercepted by U.S. officials.

""I directed the Wildlife Inspectors and the CBP Agricultural Specialists to not open the small potato chip canisters until we could take them to a more controlled and safe environment. However, while I was interviewing Agricultural Specialist [Jaime] Pimentel (described above), WI [Cory] Kawabata opened one of the canisters and verified there was a snake inside (at the time, the snake was passive and did not attempt to strike at WI Kawabata).""

Passive or no, the rest of the canisters were run through an X-ray machine.

82,snopes107,0,https://www.militarytimes.com/2017/07/21/honorably-discharged-veterans-will-soon-get-to-shop-tax-free/,Honorably discharged veterans will soon get to shop tax-free,"OFFUTT AIR FORCE BASE, Neb. — Hey veterans, you can soon shop tax free.

Starting later this year, all honorably discharged veterans, no matter their branch of service, will be eligible to shop tax-free online at the Army & Air Force Exchange Service with the same discounts they enjoyed on base while in the military. It’s the latest way in which the organization is trying to keep its customers as the armed forces shrink and airmen and soldiers buy more for delivery.


Adding 13 million potential new customers will give extra ammunition to the group that runs the stores on U.S. Army and Air Force bases worldwide as it fights Amazon and other retailers for veterans’ online shopping dollars.Since hiring its first civilian CEO five years ago, the Exchange has upgraded the brands at base stores to include items like Disney toys, Michael Kors fashions and other top names. Like private stores, it’s also imposed tighter cost controls, reduced the number of employees and improved people’s experience on the website.

“The intent is to really beat Amazon at their game because we have locations literally on the installations,” said CEO Tom Shull. “We’re leaning toward not just ship-from-store but pick-up-from-store and eventually deliver-from-store.”

The Exchange is adding shipping centers within its stores to allow it to send products directly from those locations more cheaply and quickly. Twenty-six stores now ship orders, and that will expand to 55 by the end of the year.

Within the next three years, Shull said the goal is to deliver something on base within two hours of when it is ordered. That’s possible partly because the Exchanges are already on base, cleared by security.

The Exchange delivers most orders on the second day now. Shull said shipping from stores will make a big difference in regions around bases, which are often in more rural areas.

Expanding online shopping to all honorably discharged veterans is expected to add about $200 million annually within three years to the $8.3 billion in sales the Exchanges generated last year.

Adding those shoppers, what Shull called “the foundation of our growth,” is critical to help offset the 13 percent decline in the number of active-duty Army and Air Force soldiers since 2011 when the Exchange generated $10.3 billion revenue.

“It’s a modest benefit, but it can save you thousands of dollars a year,” said Shull, a graduate of the U.S. Military Academy who served in the Army for a decade before starting a retail career at chains including Macy’s.

Former Marine Forrest Cornelius was among the first to sign up at the verification website when it launched in June, and got a chance to start shopping early to test it out. The 51-year-old was impressed by the site and a deal he found on Ray-Ban sunglasses.

“The biggest thing is price. They’re always going to be a little bit cheaper,” said Cornelius, who lives in Dallas.

But competing on price in today’s retail environment is increasingly difficult, said Edward Jones analyst Brian Yarbrough. Just look at how much trouble Walmart has competing with Amazon, he said, because Walmart has the fixed costs associated with its stores.

“To think you’re going to compete on price, you’re going to have a hard time there,” he said.

Under Shull’s leadership, the Exchange stores have traded their industrial feel and reliance on off-brand merchandise for a more modern look featuring well-known labels.

Two-thirds of the main Exchange store at Offutt Air Force Base resembles any department store, with prominent displays of name-brand makeup, Nike fitness gear and Carter’s clothes for kids. The rest is filled with the kind of electronics, appliances, housewares and toys found at Walmart or Sears, with major brands in every section.

The Exchanges don’t pay rent for their military base locations, and the government transports some of their supplies and goods to far-flung locations, but otherwise they operate mostly like an independent retailer. Roughly two-thirds of the employees are family members of soldiers or airmen.

The Exchange, which is part of the Defense Department, reported earnings of $384 million last year. That’s a sharp contrast from five years ago when Shull arrived to projections of $180 million in losses.

Of last year’s profit, $225 million was returned to the defense department to help pay for quality-of-life programs on bases like child development and fitness centers. Besides the main stores, the Exchanges also operate more than 70 movie theaters and bring in franchise restaurants and other vendors for the shopping malls it operates on bases.

Shull feels those are good reasons for the new online shopping privileges to draw veterans to do their shopping there.

“Veterans value the cost savings and what they can do to support the military,” he said."
83,snopes108,0,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-40710051,Wisconsin company Three Square Market to microchip employees,"A Wisconsin company is to become the first in the US to microchip employees.

Three Square Market is offering to implant the tiny radio-frequency identification (RFID) chip into workers' hands for free - and says everyone will soon be doing it.

The rice grain-sized $300 (£230) chip will allow them to open doors, log in to computers and even purchase food.

And so far, 50 employees have signed up for the chance to become half-human, half-walking credit card.

But far from being some sort of dystopian nightmare, Three Square Market's Patrick McMullan believes everyone will soon be wanting their own microchip.

The international market place is wide open and we believe that the future trajectory of total market share is going to be driven by whoever captures this arena first,"" Mr McMullan said.

The company, which provides self-service ""micro markets"" to businesses around the world, was inspired by the micro-chipping already taking place in Sweden, where so-called ""bio-hackers"" have been inserting the tiny devices into willing participants for at least three years.

Three Square Market are even working with a Swedish company, BioHax, to deliver the new technology, which they see as one day being simply another payment and identification method - only instead of a credit card or phone, there would be a microchip between your thumb and finger.

But how did employees react?
While a large proportion of the world might think twice before putting a tiny chip in their hand, it seems those at Three Square Market had no such worries.

Out of 85 employees at the company's head office, 50 have come forward, vice-president of international development Tony Danna told the BBC.

""The people that wanted it were like yes, no hesitation,"" he said.

Can they be tracked?
""That is going to be the inevitable reaction,"" Mr Danna acknowledged.

""But there is no GPS tracking ability to it. It is really the same thing as the chip that is in your credit card.""

How does it go in - and how do you get it out?
The entire point of the chip is convenience, Mr Danna explained.

Eventually, he hopes it will replace everything you might have in your wallet - from your key fob to your credit card and ID. For now, it is just aiming to make life easier for those using Three Square Market's facilities.

But the convenience also stretches to installing and removing the chip.

""It takes about two seconds to put it in and to take it out,"" he told the BBC. Putting it in is ""like getting a shot"" using a syringe, while taking it out it like removing a splinter.

""Easy in, easy out,"" Mr Danna said.

What if you get robbed?
Like everything in life, it could happen.

But, says Mr Danna, at least it is all in one place, making it easier to cancel all those cards."

It’s fake.,"The framed copy of Time magazine was hung up in at least five of President Trump’s clubs, from South Florida to Scotland. Filling the entire cover was a photo of Donald Trump.

“Donald Trump: The ‘Apprentice’ is a television smash!” the big headline said. Above the Time nameplate, there was another headline in all caps: “TRUMP IS HITTING ON ALL FRONTS . . . EVEN TV!”

This cover — dated March 1, 2009 — looks like an impressive memento from Trump’s pre-presidential career. To club members eating lunch, or golfers waiting for a pro-shop purchase, it seemed to be a signal that Trump had always been a man who mattered. Even when he was just a reality TV star, Trump was the kind of star who got a cover story in Time.

But that wasn’t true.

The Time cover is a fake.

There was no March 1, 2009, issue of Time magazine. And there was no issue at all in 2009 that had Trump on the cover.

In fact, the cover on display at Trump’s clubs, observed recently by a reporter visiting one of the properties, contains several small but telling mistakes. Its red border is skinnier than that of a genuine Time cover, and, unlike the real thing, there is no thin white border next to the red. The Trump cover’s secondary headlines are stacked on the right side — on a real Time cover, they would go across the top.

And it has two exclamation points. Time headlines don’t yell.

“I can confirm that this is not a real TIME cover,” Kerri Chyka, a spokeswoman for Time Inc., wrote in an email to The Washington Post.


The real Time cover, left, and the fake Donald Trump cover. (Left: Time. Right: Angel Valentin for The Washington Post)
At 5 p.m. Tuesday, a spokeswoman for Time said that the magazine had asked the Trump Organization to remove the phony cover from the walls where it was on display.

So how did Trump — who spent an entire campaign and much of his presidency accusing the mainstream media of producing “fake news” — wind up decorating his properties with a literal piece of phony journalism?

The Trump Organization did not respond to questions this week about who made the cover and why it was displayed at Trump clubs. White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders declined to say whether Trump had known that the cover wasn’t real.

“We couldn’t comment on the decor at Trump Golf clubs one way or another,” Sanders wrote in an email.

The cover seems to fit a broader pattern for Trump, who has often boasted of his appearances on Time’s cover and adorned his Trump Tower office with images of himself from magazines and newspapers. Trump has made claims about himself — about his charitable giving, his business success, even the size of the crowd at his inauguration — that are not supported by the facts.

In this case, Trump’s golf clubs might seem like places where he wouldn’t need to stretch the truth. Reality is flattering enough. The clubs are monuments to Trump’s success — they bear his name and are filled with his images. But, still, his staff added an extra trophy that was phony.

It is not clear who created this fake Time cover — or why.

Its date might be a clue: March 1, 2009, was the season debut of Trump’s show “The Celebrity Apprentice.” But a transcript of that show offers no answers. In that episode, various B-list celebrities competed to sell cupcakes, and Trump fired comedian Andrew Dice Clay for poor performance. Nobody mentioned Time magazine.

While it’s not difficult to mock up a fake cover using graphic-design software, whoever made this one sought out real Time headlines, to add to the fake.

There are secondary headlines on the Trump cover that tout stories on President Barack Obama, climate change and the financial crisis. Two of those are taken from a real March 2, 2009, issue of Time, which featured actress Kate Winslet on the cover. But the issue makes no mention of Trump.

Another possible clue to the fake cover’s origins: The fake bar code on the bottom right. An identical bar code shows up online in a graphic-design tutorial posted in 2010, in which a Peruvian designer laid out how to make a fake Time cover — complete with this bar code, for extra realism. The graphic designer did not immediately respond to questions from The Post.

The Post found that the fake cover had been hung in at least four of Trump’s 17 golf clubs.

At Trump’s resort in Doral, Fla., outside Miami, the fake image hangs in two prominent spots.

In the pro shop, it shares a wall with 11 other framed magazine pages — all of them highlighting Trump, another member of the Trump family or a Trump golf course.

Among the covers with Trump’s face on them, the Time cover looks like one of the most impressive. The others are old — such as a 1984 cover of GQ — or from less-prominent titles, such as Fairways + Greens magazine and TV Guide Canada. Those two publications are out of print.

A copy of the fake cover also hangs in Champions, the Doral resort’s sports bar. It faces a framed cover of Fortune magazine from 2004, showing Trump’s face with the headline “Trumped.” That one is real.


Magazine covers hang on a wall at the Trump National Doral golf shop. (Angel Valentin for The Washington Post)
In Virginia, the phony Time cover hangs on the wall of the members’ dining room at the Trump golf course in suburban Loudoun County, near Washington. Trump has visited that club more frequently since moving into the White House. In early June, the president ate lunch in that dining room with football star Peyton Manning and Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.).

A photo taken during their lunch shows that Trump’s chair faced the fake Time cover.

At the same club, Trump’s staff put up a historical marker declaring that there had been a Civil War battle on the site — and that the adjacent Potomac River became a “River of Blood.” Historians say this battle never happened. The marker was first reported by the New York Times.

In addition, the fake cover was hung up near the entrance of Trump’s Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, Fla., according to a photo taken in July 2016 by Scott Keeler, a photographer at the Tampa Bay Times. Keeler posted it Tuesday on Twitter.

The Time cover also appears to have been hung up at Trump’s golf resort in Doonbeg, in western Ireland. Trump bought the club in 2014. Photos posted on TripAdvisor show it on the wall of a dining room. But when a reporter visited the club this past weekend, it was gone.

A bartender later found it in the manager’s office. Officials at the club could not explain why it had been moved.

And at Trump’s Turnberry club in Scotland, employees said they recognized the cover. It had been added after Trump bought the course in 2014, said the employees, who spoke to The Post on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment to the media. One employee said the fake cover had previously hung in the resort’s pub, called the Duel in the Sun after a famous golf match played at Turnberry in 1977. 

But, she said, the cover was taken down a few weeks ago.

“We used to have a Time magazine cover up — aye, it was there for ages and ages, as long as I’ve been here. I know the one you’re on about,” the employee said. “But they came and took it down a while back.”

In its place, the club had hung up an old-timey photo of the course.

Club officials did not respond to queries about why it was taken down. The employee said it was part of a general reduction in photos of Trump.

“We certainly have been hearing more grumbling about all the stuff like that up on the walls since his election,” the employee said. “From Americans, mostly, funny enough. That’s why we all assumed they started taking some of his photos off the walls.”

“But it was just a guess. I don’t actually have a scooby,” the employee added, using an expression that means, “I don’t have a clue.” 
The Post also looked for the fake cover at two Trump courses in the United States that are open to the public, in the Bronx and in Rancho Palos Verdes, Calif. It was not on display at either. The rest of Trump’s courses are members-only, making it difficult to get inside to look at the decor.

The image does not appear to be among the many framed magazine covers that adorn Trump’s old office in Trump Tower, based on photos of the office.

One thing that is clear, from the president’s past statements, is that he views the cover of Time as a significant honor.

Trump has bragged that he’s been on more Time covers than anyone. “I think we have the all-time record in the history of Time magazine,” he said during a January speech at CIA headquarters.

That is wrong. Richard Nixon has appeared on far more than Trump.

In a 2016 interview, when Trump was a candidate, he offered a mental tally of how many times he had appeared on the magazine’s cover.

“I think I was on the cover of Time magazine twice in my life and like six times in the last number of months. So you tell me, which is more important, real estate or politics, okay?” Trump said. “I have six for politics, and I have two for real estate or whatever they put me on for.”

But that count was wrong.

According to Time magazine’s tally, Trump had been on the cover only once before he got into politics. That was in January 1989."

The students, in general, did not do anything wrong and I feel this tactic would only criminalize them and make the school more of a prison than a safe learning environment.

The issue, as I see it, is the lack of attention to a child who is crying for help. Without passing any blame, I strongly believe that it is a group effort to monitor and pay attention to such children. I also think the staff should evaluate the environment the individual is raised in, their history, etc., to see why they may be exhibiting certain questionable behavior and to address potential issues.

86,snopes110,0,https://wydaily.com/health/2017/06/04/health-tick-borne-meat-allergies-on-the-rise-in-hampton-roads/,A carnivore’s nightmare: Tick-borne meat allergies rising in Hampton Roads,"In 2015, Kerry Armbruster of Williamsburg said she received “the best Christmas present ever.” A diagnosis—with the Alpha-gal allergy, also known as Mammalian Meat Allergy, which is commonly referred to as the red meat allergy.

“I knew that I wasn’t dying of cancer, or Parkinson’s disease,” said Armbruster, who teaches kindergarten at Matthew Whaley School in Williamsburg.

That was a relief, because Armbruster’s symptoms—difficulty walking, and swelling in her head, hands and feet—potentially pointed to those conditions.

She’d also broken out in hives and had several visits to the ER. She’d been seen by three specialists, and missed twenty days of school between Halloween and Christmas.

“In hindsight [those symptoms] were a godsend,” she said. “There are people who have it and don’t know it.”

Not that the Alpha-gal allergy isn’t a serious condition. “It’s a life-changing thing, like being diabetic,” Armbruster said.

Now a self-described “medical vegan,” she avoids all contact with Mammalian products.

More deer equals more ticks
Red meat allergies are on the rise in Hampton Roads. Williamsburg in particular, said Dr. Ann Zilliox, an allergist and immunologist in Newport News, “is in the middle of the bull’s eye” because of its significant white-tailed deer population—the main host of the lone-star tick that transfers the Alpha-gal molecule from deer to humans.

Armbruster doesn’t recall the tick bite that gave her the allergy. It could have been any number of tick bites. Like many people in Williamsburg, she lives in a wooded neighborhood—First Colony on the James River.

“We do a lot of walking and biking, and we are surrounded by trees and deer. We can have eight deer in any one day,” she said.

Her neighborhood, like others in Williamsburg, is a safe haven for deer because hunting isn’t allowed, and there aren’t other predators like mountain lions and bears, said Matthias Leu, a biology professor at William and Mary, who is working on the school’s “Tick Project.”

Leu is specifically looking at changes in the tick population in the Virginia Peninsula–and how various environmental factors may influence the prevalence of tick-borne diseases.

“For ticks, it’s not a clear-cut story,” Leu said. However, one thing is clear: “If you have fewer hosts, you have fewer ticks.”

“The deer population has skyrocketed, and you can follow that line with alpha gal [allergy],” Zilliox said, adding that’s true for much of the Mid-Atlantic region.

And ticks are drawn to the deer because of their size, added Brent Kaup, a professor of environmental sociology at William and Mary who also works on the tick project.

“The deer are large mammals, and because of that, when they tromp through the woods, they are more likely to pick up ticks because of their size,” Kaup said.

Deers, like all non-primate animals, have the Alpha-gal carbohydrate to which some humans are allergic.

“It’s like any other allergy,” Zilliox explained. “There can be a lot of people exposed to cats, and only one person will have an immune response.

“It’s a little bit of an immunological crapshoot,” Zilliox continued. “Certainly, the more you are bit, the greater your risk.”

 A food allergy that breaks the rules
Like Armbruster, Ann Mease lives in a wooded neighborhood off Jamestown Road in Williamsburg. Mease does a lot of yardwork, and once, late at night in the spring of 2012, her hands swelled, and she broke out in hives.

She popped a Benadryl, but the swelling increased, so she went to the ER. By the time she got there, her symptoms were less severe, so she went home.

The next morning, she was telling a group of friends what had happened. One of her friends, who had been diagnosed with the meat allergy, asked Mease if she’d eaten any meat that night; and if she’d recently been bitten by a tick.

Mease’s answer to both questions was yes: She’d eaten a hamburger for dinner, and she recalled having a tick on her earlier that week. Mease then followed up with her allergist, Zilliox, and Mease’s blood work came back positive for Alpha-gal.

“There are many unanswered questions about this [allergy],” Zilliox said. “It takes everything that we thought was a hard and fast rule about food allergies and turns it on its head.”

Namely, she adds: it’s a carbohydrate (most food allergies are related to proteins); it’s related to a tick bite, and the allergic reaction is not immediate.

Allergic reactions occur three to six hours after contact with Mammalian products because of the longer digestion process for meat, Mease said.

That delay can be a blessing, Zilliox added, recalling one of her patients on a trip to Chicago who had forgotten his EpiPen. When he realized that he’d eaten something with meat in it, he was able to call Zilliox and have her call in a prescription for another EpiPen to the nearest pharmacy.

“If that was peanuts or shellfish, it would have been over in two minutes,” she said. “In allergies, we assume we have no time at all to plan for things.”

As with all food allergies, there are no shots, so all her Zilliox’s patients carry EpiPen with them. The severity of peoples’ reactions also varies greatly—which a blood test can measure—and can change over time, generally becoming less severe, she added.

“It’s unclear what the natural progression of the allergy is,” she said. “Some people can start eating meat again, but the party line is one you’ve been tested positive for Alpha-gal, avoid meat 100 percent.”

Another unusual thing about the allergy is that it was initially discovered, not in meat per se, but in a chemotherapy drug (cetuximab) with trace amounts of animal product, Zilliox explained. Patients were having anaphylactic shock after taking the drug.

It was researchers at the University of Virginia connected the dots in the early 2000s, by mapping out the geographical areas of the patients who were reactive with maps of lone star ticks, she added.

The best prevention: don’t get bit
That finding in turn led to the identification of the Alpha-gal molecule as the culprit—which has subsequently meant that more and more people are getting properly diagnosed with what was once a mystery condition, Zilliox said.

“We have seen people with this problem for probably twenty years of longer,” Zilliox said. “We’ve finally sort of caught up,” to the back-log of patients. In the past decade, she’s treated about sixty patients with the allergy.

“People who work outside all the time are at greatest risk,” she said. “It’s really hard for them to dress like winter in summer.”

But everyone should in any case, try to prevent tick bites by covering up, wearing a repellent, and tucking pants into socks, she added.

If there’s a silver lining that both Mease and Armbruster agree on, it’s that they eat a healthier diet now.

“It’s made me a healthy person because I’ve really learned about food, which is a good thing,” Armbruster said."

""I grew up in this district; I grew up in this community — it's my home. My family is still there,"" Ossoff said during an interview on CNN's ""New Day."" Ossoff currently lives just outside Georgia's 6th Congressional District with his girlfriend, while she is attending medical school. He said that he has been transparent about the fact that he doesn't live in the district and pledged to move back to the district as soon as his girlfriend finishes school.

""I'm a mile and a half down the street to support Alicia while she finishes medical school. It's something I've been very transparent about,"" he said. ""In fact, I'm proud to be supporting her career.""

""As soon as she finishes her medical training, I'll be 10 minutes back up the road into the district where I grew up,"" he continued.

Ossoff is facing a crowded field of Republicans on Tuesday to fill the vacated seat of now-Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price, who previously represented the 6th District.

The scrutiny over Ossoff's residency has intensified as the race has grown tighter.

Democrats are treating the race as a referendum on President Trump and the current Republican-led Congress, and Ossoff has run an unexpectedly competitive campaign in a GOP-leaning district. 

In a special House election in Kansas last week, Republican Ron Estes narrowly slid to victory in a deep-red district — an outcome that could be an early indicator of tough reelection bids for Republicans in next year’s midterms.

Looking to secure a win for their parties in the Georgia election, both Democrats and Republicans have dramatically upped campaign efforts in the district. 

The Congressional Leadership Fund, a super PAC aligned with Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), has spent more than $2 million in the district. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, on the other hand, has run six-figure ad buys and get-out-the-vote campaigns.

Tuesday's special election is an all-party affair. Any candidate can win by taking a 50 percent majority of the vote. But if no candidate reaches that threshold, the top two finishers will head to a runoff."

Cecilia Wessels snapped the picture of her husband, Theunis, on Friday evening as the twister passed near their home in Three Hills.

She says cutting the grass was on her husband's to-do list, and as he started the task, she went for a nap.
Wessels says she was woken by her nine-year-old daughter who was upset that there was something like a tornado in the sky, but her father wouldn't come inside.

Theunis Wessels says the tornado was actually much further away than it appears in the photo, and that it was moving away from them.

There have been no reports of injuries from the tornado, although some other photos show downed trees and a barn with its roof ripped off.

""I literally took the picture to show my mum and dad in South Africa, 'Look there's a tornado,' and now everyone is like, 'Why is your husband mowing the lawn?""' Cecilia Wessels said Saturday.

""Our whole street, everyone was on their back patios taking pictures,"" she added.

Looked closer than it was
Theunis Wessels said he was keeping watch of his surroundings and saw the twister form as the swirling connected from the sky and the ground to form the funnel.

Theunis said he watched a TV program about storm chasers, so he's familiar with them.

The tornado moved away to the east, he said.

""It looks much closer if you look in the photo, but it was really far away. Well, not really far, far away, but it was far away from us,"" he said.

""I was keeping an eye on it."""

Well, Donald Trump and his “Trump Make America Great Again Committee” seem to be of that persuasion. The 45th U.S. president’s camp has begun the early rollout of “Big League” Boxes, a subscription box that delivers Trump/Pence campaign merchandise to your door at the cost of $69 per month. We have a lot of questions.

CNN reporter Betsy Klein was one of the first to tweet about the marketing ploy and posted screenshots of an email directed at campaign donors.

“The President wanted to make sure you got this special offer,” the email reads in boldface type. “Because of your overwhelming support, you’re on our list for the FIRST ROUND of Big League Boxes!”

The letter goes on to explain what a Big League Box is, describing the subscription service as “a handpicked bundle of exclusive and vintage OFFICIAL Donald J. Trump merchandise delivered to your door every month as a recurring donor.” 


Public Integrity political reporter Dave Levinthal corroborated with images of his own:

No word on when the Big League Box is expected to be made available to the general public or why now seemed like the right time to launch the service. Birchbox, this is not."
90,snopes114,0,https://time.com/4362393/donald-trump-supported-addressing-climate-change-before-calling-it-a-hoax/,Donald Trump Supported Addressing Climate Change Before Calling It a 'Hoax',"Presumptive GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump called for strong measures to address climate change as recently as 2009—a position in direct conflict with his numerous dismissals of the issue as a “hoax.”

Trump’s 2009 stance came in the form of an open letter to President Barack Obama and Congress published in the New York Times. The letter, first reported by Grist, was signed by Trump and other prominent business leaders in advance of the 2009 Copenhagen climate talks that most experts agree ended in failure. Trump’s children—Eric, Ivanka and Donald Jr.—all joined the letter as well.

“We support your effort to ensure meaningful and effective measures to control climate change, an immediate challenge facing the United States and the world today,” the letter says. “Please allow us, the United States of America, to serve in modeling the change necessary to protect humanity and our planet.”

Throughout the campaign Trump has challenged the urgency of addressing climate change using a variety of explanations from saying that the issue was “created by and for the Chinese” and that he believes climate change is merely weather. His energy policy proposals—to the extent that he has any—suggest a similar view. He has promised to “cancel” the Paris Agreement to address climate change and to expand the use of coal.

The letter is not the only inconsistency in Trump’s position on climate. The former reality TV star applied for a permit to build a seawall to protect the Trump International Golf Links & Hotel Ireland from rising sea levels due to “global warming and its effects.”"

And while he was there, Mr. Trump wrote a note in the visitors book.

His message read, ""It is a great honor to be here with all of my friends – so amazing & will never forget!""Presidents and politicians alike make a point of spending time at Yad Vashem to pay homage to victims and survivors of the Holocaust and often leave such notes to commemorate their struggle.

In July 2008, Barack Obama visited during his first presidential campaign. Here's his note:

""I am grateful to Yad Vashem and all of those responsible for this remarkable institution. At a time of great peril and promise, war and strife, we are blessed to have such a powerful reminder of man's potential for great evil, but also our own capacity to rise up from tragedy and remake our world. Let our children come here, and know their history, so that they can add their voices to proclaim 'never again.' And may we remember those who perished, not only as victims, but also as individuals who hoped and loved and dreamed like us, and who have become symbols of the human spirit.""

Then-president George W. Bush inscribed a brief message-- ""God bless Israel""-- a few months earlier, in January 2008. 
Bill Clinton, who visited the memorial in his first term, was optimistic about the prospects for Middle East peace when wrote this in the book: 
""Today we have come one step closer to the time when the people of Israel will live in peace with all of their neighbors, when the awful events of death and destruction memorialized here will be banished to the past.""   

During her time as secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, Mr. Trump's Democratic presidential opponent in the 2016 election, left the following note in March 2009:

""Yad Vashem is a testament to the power of truth in the face of denial, the resilience of the human spirit in the face of despair, the triumph of the Jewish people over murder and destruction and a reminder to all people that the lessons of the Holocaust must never be forgotten,"" Clinton's note said. ""God bless Israel and its future."""
92,snopes116,0,https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2017/05/trump-orb/527574/,"So, What Was the Deal With the Orb?","President Trump’s visit this weekend to Saudi Arabia was largely hailed as a success: He appeared to enjoy himself on his first foreign trip as president; he announced billions in Saudi investment in the U.S.; and his speech on terrorism was well received. But it was one photograph Sunday that got much of the attention online 

In the image, Trump, Saudi King Salman bin Abdulaziz, and Egyptian President Abdel Fatah al-Sisi have their hands on an orb that lit up upon their touch, an image that immediately drew humorous comparisons online with comic-book villains, Star Wars protagonists, and Star Trek mind control—not to mention references to the Illuminati and Lord of the Rings. Saudi news reports set the record straight, saying the illuminated orb was, in fact, a globe, and that by placing their hands on it, the three leaders “officially activated the” Global Center for Combating Extremist Ideology in Riyadh, a facility that will monitor extremist messaging in real time.

Extremist messaging online has been particularly effective in attracting recruits to terrorist groups such as ISIS, which espouses a strict version of Sunni Islam, and which the U.S. and its allies, including Saudi Arabia, are fighting. But Saudi Arabia also finances religious schools around the world that teach a form of Sunni Islam that many critics say contributes to the spread of radical ideology among youth.

Trump, in his speech Sunday in Riyadh, focused on countering terrorism, but directed his attention to Shia Iran, Sunni Saudi Arabia’s main regional rival.

“Starving terrorists of their territory, their funding, and the false allure of their craven ideology, will be the basis for defeating them,” he said. “But no discussion of stamping out this threat would be complete without mentioning the government that gives terrorists all three—safe harbor, financial backing, and the social standing needed for recruitment. It is a regime that is responsible for so much instability in the region. I am speaking of course of Iran.”

Those remarks came as Iranians celebrated the re-election of Hassan Rouhani, the president who advocated opening to the West and struck a nuclear deal with Western powers. Trump also cited Iran’s role in the Syrian civil war, where it, along with Russia, supports President Bashar al-Assad; and in Yemen, where it is fighting a proxy war with Saudi Arabia for control of the Arab country. Saudi Arabia and Iran accuse each other of fomenting unrest in the region. The Obama administration’s nuclear deal was viewed by the Arab world as a giveaway to Iran because it came with massive sanctions relief in exchange for the Islamic Republic’s concessions on its nuclear program. Trump’s remarks Sunday showed that the U.S. would once again ally more openly with Sunni Arab states against the Islamic republic.

93,snopes117,0,https://edition.cnn.com/2017/05/12/health/grey-death-opioid-drug/index.html,Grey death': The powerful street drug that's puzzling authorities,"A new drug called ""grey death"" has been linked to a handful of lethal overdoses in the South -- but no one knows exactly what's in it or where it's coming from.

The drug, a mix of opioids, can kill in very small doses and looks like concrete mixing powder.
""When I hear about something new like grey death, my first thought is, 'Is there some novel compound we haven't discovered yet?' "" said Donna Iula, director of forensic chemistry at Cayman Chemical, a biotechnology company that works with federal and state crime labs to identify unknown street drugs.
Over the past four months, Georgia police have seized about 50 batches of grey death statewide, with metro Atlanta being a major hotspot. The drug has also started popping up in Alabama, Ohio and Pennsylvania, state and local officials confirmed.
Because ingredients change from sample to sample, each batch of grey death is a mystery -- right down to its signature color.
""To this date, I have no idea what makes it gray,"" said Deneen Kilcrease, a forensic chemist with the Georgia Bureau of Investigation's crime lab. ""Nothing in and of itself should be that color.""A deadly opioid brew called ""grey death"" owes its name to its unique concrete powder appearance.
Investigators have found a variety of opioids in grey death samples: designer drug U-47700, heroin, fentanyl and fentanyl-like molecules. Because each drug is present in such low concentrations, some of them may not show up on tests, Kilcrease said.
""These chemicals are all very potent and very deadly in isolation, but in the wrong hands ... that's a fast-track route to the morgue,"" Iula said. 
""There have been several overdoses and overdose-related deaths across Georgia and Alabama linked to grey death,"" a report from the Gulf Coast High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area said. Toxicology and autopsy results are still pending for the Georgia cases, Kilcrease said.
Two of the men who overdosed were in Auburn, Alabama, according to the report. One man injected the drug, and another snorted it. When the IV drug user passed out, the other man tried to resuscitate him before overdosing himself, the report said.
Because lab tests may pick up only one ingredient, like heroin or fentanyl, there may be other overdoses from grey death that we don't know about, Kilcrease said. But there is no way of knowing for sure.
Georgia has confirmed six deaths from U-47700 and 12 deaths from furanylfentanyl this year, Kilcrease said.
""You can throw anything in a baggie and call it 'grey death,' "" Iula said. ""It's going to constantly vary, and it's going to keep the chemists and the medical examiners on their toes."" 
A grayish form of gravel-like heroin has been reported in multiple regions since 2012, the US Drug Enforcement Administration said. But that concoction did not contain U-47700, commonly known as ""pink."" 
In November, the DEA listed U-47700 as a Schedule I drug, a restrictive category for drugs with a high potential for abuse. The agency took this emergency measure after dozens of deaths across the country.
""Because substances like U-47700 are often manufactured in illicit labs overseas, the identity, purity, and quantity are unknown, creating a 'Russian Roulette' scenario for any user,"" the DEA said in a statement.
Shortly after the DEA took action, Kilcrease and her colleagues began noticing the appearance of new fentanyl-like drugs. By changing the fentanyl molecule slightly, Kilcrease said, foreign chemists may be skirting US laws and exporting drugs faster than the DEA can regulate them. Moreover, some of these substances are far stronger than fentanyl itself.
A single flake of pure carfentanil can tranquilize a 2,000-pound elephant, Kilcrease said. The drug is 100 times more potent than fentanyl and 10,000 times more potent than morphine. It can float through the air or be absorbed by touch and has been found in some mixes of grey death, Kilcrease said.
""If you think carfentanil is scary, there are actually compounds in the literature that are more potent,"" Iula said.
""A lethal dose is not even visible to the eye,"" she added. ""That gives me the chills."""
94,snopes118,0,https://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-texas-sanctuary-law-20170504-story.html,Texas’ new ban on ‘sanctuary cities’ could put police in jail if they fail to enforce immigration holds,"Texas Gov. Greg Abbott was poised Thursday to sign the nation’s most stringent law yet to target “sanctuary cities,” a measure that could impose heavy fines or even jail time on local law enforcement officials who refuse to honor immigration detention requests.

After weeks of heated debate, sit-ins and protests at the state Capitol in Austin, Texas lawmakers Wednesday night passed the sweeping bill that would ban sanctuary cities and allow police to inquire about the immigration status of anyone they detained, even those stopped for minor traffic violations. It would also force local officials to comply with federal immigration requests to detain those who are suspected of being in the country illegally.

Police chiefs and county sheriffs who refuse to comply with federal requests, which are not mandatory under federal law, could face up to a year in jail. Cities, counties and colleges could also face stiff fines, from $1,000 to $25,500 a day.

Abbott has said he will sign the bill in the coming days, and immigrant advocates are gearing up for a court fight.

“This is unprecedented,” said Angie Junck, supervising attorney at the Immigrant Legal Resource Center in San Francisco, who argued the bill violated 4th Amendment protections against warrantless arrests without probable cause and raised concerns about racial profiling.

“It’s not only telling law enforcement to engage in unconstitutional behavior, but it’s then seeking to punish them for a crime,” she said. “It’s astonishing.”

The Texas legislation, Senate Bill 4, passed amid a fierce national debate on sanctuary cities, jurisdictions which decline to hold immigrants arrested for local crimes past their release date simply because immigration authorities want them detained for potential deportation proceedings.

Shortly after his inauguration, President Trump issued an executive order on immigration that threatened to strip federal funds from cities that did not cooperate with federal immigration enforcement. That provision of the order is in legal limbo after a federal judge in Northern California temporarily blocked it last week, concluding that cities could prevail in their argument that placing new conditions on federal funds is unconstitutional.

On Thursday, Maryland Atty. Gen. Brian E. Frosh issued a memo warning that state and local law enforcement officers were “potentially exposed to liability” if they honored immigration detainer requests — unless the request is accompanied by a judicial warrant or supported by information providing probable cause that the person has committed a crime.

While other states have passed laws urging municipalities to assist federal immigration efforts — Mississippi’s governor signed a law in March that bars sanctuary jurisdictions — legal experts say the Texas bill is the first to explicitly make it mandatory to honor U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detainers, with noncompliance subject to criminal penalties.

“This law takes some of the federal policies that we’ve seen and puts it on steroids,” Junck said. “It seems this governor and the Texas Legislature are trying to outdo the federal government and design their own plan for deportations of residents and to create fear within anyone that’s in the immigrant community to drive them out of the state of Texas.”

Abbott, who has promised he will “not tolerate sanctuary-city policies that put the cities of Texas at risk,” has signaled that he plans to sign the bill. Shortly after it won final legislative approval Wednesday, he wrote on Twitter: “I’m getting my signing pen warmed up.”

Legal experts say the Texas bill is even stricter than Arizona’s widely criticized 2010 law, SB 1070, that required police officers to demand the papers of people suspected of being in the country illegally. After a string of lawsuits and boycotts, that law was eventually amended.

Republican officials who have supported the legislation say it is needed to ensure that those who have committed crimes and are in the country illegally are deported.

“SB 4 will ensure that no liberal local official can flaunt the law,” Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick said in a statement. “This legislation will eliminate a substantial incentive for illegal immigration and help make Texas communities safer.”

A wide range of opponents — immigrant advocates, Democratic legislators, police organizations and politicians from cities such as Austin and Houston with large immigrant populations — had made it a priority to defeat the bill.

“I am concerned that we’re the canary in the coal mine and other states will start attempting to pass draconian anti-immigrant laws,” said Gregorio Casar, an Austin city councilman who represents a heavily Latino part of north Austin. On Monday, he was one of two dozen protesters arrested and charged with trespassing after occupying the lobby of the governor’s office in protest of the bill.

“You’re going to see the people of Texas fight this law every single step of the way, because it’s unconstitutional, it’s dangerous, it’s bad for the economy and it isn’t the state’s business to be cracking down on immigrants,” Casar added.

In turn, Republican Sen. Charles Perry, who wrote the bill, has accused opponents of fear-mongering. The bill, he has argued, provides “uniform application of the law without prejudice” to everyone in Texas.

“Banning sanctuary cities is about stopping officials who have sworn to enforce the law from helping people who commit terrible crimes evade immigration detainers,” he said in a statement.

Police chiefs and sheriffs of major jurisdictions across Texas have spoken out against the bill, arguing that requiring local law enforcement to take a more active role in immigration enforcement will create fear among immigrant communities, foster distrust of police and eventually lead to an uptick in crime.

Travis County Sheriff Sally Hernandez, who made headlines this year when she announced she would not voluntarily comply with federal requests to detain people solely on the basis of their immigration status, said the bill passed as a result of fear and misinformation.

“I am disappointed, because this is not in the best interest of public safety,” she said Thursday in a statement. “It ties the hands of our law enforcement agency and pushes victims of crime into the shadows. While I hate seeing a state law like this come to pass, I have always followed the law and that will not change.”

In an opinion piece published in the Dallas Morning News, David Pughes, interim chief of police in Dallas, and Art Acevedo, chief of police in Houston, wrote that the bill was “political pandering that will make our communities more dangerous.”

“Such a divide between the local police and immigrant groups will result in increased crime against immigrants and in the broader community, create a class of silent victims, and eliminate the potential for assistance from immigrants in solving crimes or preventing crime,” they said.

In recent weeks, Texas Democrats and moderate Republicans worked desperately to try to tone down the bill. Last week, Democratic lawmakers in the Republican-dominated House wore all black as they engaged in a marathon overnight session to defeat the legislation. But after 16 hours of emotional debate, the bill that eventually passed the House 93 to 54 was stricter than previous versions.

One late amendment, criticized by Democratic lawmakers, says police departments cannot discourage officers from inquiring about the immigration status of those who have been detained, even during routine traffic stops. Legal experts warn this would allow sheriff’s deputies and police officers to question a person’s legal status without having probable cause.

“It has gone from a bad bill to a worse bill,” Sen. Sylvia Garcia, a Democrat who represents Houston, warned in remarks to the Senate on Wednesday. She said she feared the legislation could lead to police harassment and profiling of Latinos.

“The last thing I want is ‘walking while brown’ to become reasonable suspicion,” she said. “And, frankly, that is what will happen with this legislation — it doesn’t matter how much its supporters promise that this will not happen. It will happen.”

Already, Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents arrest more people in the state of Texas than in other state.

From fiscal year 2014 through 2016, Texas received 58,452 federal immigration detainer requests, compared with 46,444 detainers issued in California, according to Syracuse University’s Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, which tracks immigration data.

Federal agents took into custody 35,632 individuals in Texas based on those detainers, more than double the number in California."
95,snopes119,0,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/may/13/david-wojnarowicz-close-to-the-knives-a-memoir-of-disintegration-artist-aids-activist,David Wojnarowicz: still fighting prejudice 24 years after his death,"You might not be familiar with the American artist and activist David Wojnarowicz’s name, but if you’re of a certain age, you have probably seen at least one image by him. His photograph of buffalo tumbling off a cliff was used as the cover of U2’s One, taking his art to a global audience a few months before his death in 1992 of Aids-related complications.

Wojnarowicz was only 37 when he died, but he left behind an extraordinary body of work, particularly considering the uncongenial circumstances of much of his short life. A refugee from a violent family, a former street kid and teen hustler, he grew up to become one of the stars of the febrile 1980s East Village art scene, alongside Kiki Smith, Nan Goldin, Keith Haring and Jean-Michel Basquiat.

His paintings were what made him famous – livid, densely symbolic visions, a kind of 20th-century American Dreamtime. But paint was by no means his only medium. His first serious work of art, made in the early 1970s, was a compelling series of black and white photographs of a man wearing a paper mask of the poet Arthur Rimbaud. This enigmatic, expressionless figure drifts through the piers and diners of New York, a dispossessed flâneur.

In the years that followed, Wojnarowicz worked with film, installation, sculpture, performance and writing, making things that testified to his perspective as an outsider, a gay man in a homophobic and violent world. One of the greatest and most abiding of all these works is Close to the Knives, an autobiography-cum-essay collection first published in America in 1991. A memoir of disintegration, he called it, alluding both to its chopped up, collaged structure and to the landscape it maps: a place of loss and danger, of transient beauty and dogged resistance. 

Wojnarowicz was driven to document the undocumented, to record and bear witness to scenes that most people never encounter. As a small boy, he and his siblings were kidnapped by their alcoholic father. In the suburbs of New Jersey they were beaten repeatedly, while neighbours pruned their flowers and mowed their lawns. Later, during the plague years, he watched his best friends die horribly, while religious leaders pontificated against safe-sex education and politicians mooted quarantine on islands.

It filled him with rage, the brutality and the waste. He writes: “I want to throw up because we’re supposed to quietly and politely make house in this killing machine called America and pay taxes to support our own slow murder, and I’m amazed that we’re not running amok in the streets and that we can still be capable of gestures of loving after lifetimes of all this.”

Knives opens with a visceral essay about his homeless years: a boy in glasses selling his skinny body to the paedophiles and creeps who hung around Times Square. He recalls days on broiling Manhattan blocks when he was so exhausted and malnourished he began to hallucinate that rats were carrying children’s arms and legs in their mouths. As a young man, Wojnarowicz had been inspired by the Beats, and that rangy, jagged tone is everywhere in his work, conjuring the strident world of the streets with an unflinching energy that recalls John Rechy’s City of Night or Jean Genet’s The Thief’s Journal.

Being homeless was a nightmare that he took years to emerge from, but the streets were also a place of wildness and freedom, a source of attraction throughout Wojnarowicz’s life. Much of the most beautiful writing here concerns cruising on the derelict Chelsea piers, looking for sex in the vast decaying rooms that extended out over the filthy Hudson river. “So simple,” he writes, “the appearance of night in a room full of strangers, the maze of hallways wandered as in films, the fracturing of bodies from darkness into light, sounds of plane engines easing into the distance.”

What does it mean if what you desire is illegal? Fear, frustration, fury, yes, but also a kind of political awakening, a fertile paranoia. “My queerness,” he once wrote, “was a wedge that was slowly separating me from a sick society.”

In an essay entitled “In the Shadow of the American Dream”, he describes what it is like to live like this, with the knowledge that “some of us are born with the cross-hairs of a rifle scope printed on our backs or skulls”. Out on the road, driving across the deserts of Arizona, he picks up a stranger in the restroom at Meteor Crater. They drive down a service road to embrace: two humans licking each other’s bodies, each with one eye fixed to the windscreen, the rear view mirror, watching for the bright spark of a state trooper car in the distance; each knowing that their act of desire could lead to a beating or prison, even to death.

And then death did come, in the most brutal way imaginable. The blind terror of life in the plague years: “the people waking up with the diseases of small birds or mammals; the people whose faces are entirely black with cancer eating health salads in the lonely seats of restaurants”. One by one, friends die; “piece by piece, the landscape is eroding and in its place I am building a monument made of feelings of love and hate, sadness and feelings of murder”.

The heart of Knives is the title essay, which deals with the sickness and death of the photographer Peter Hujar, Wojnarowicz’s one-time lover, his best friend and mentor, “my brother, my father, my emotional link to the world”. Nothing I have ever read matches the fury and grief of this writing, the sheer horror of watching a loved one flailing against a premature death sentence. There was no reliable treatment for Aids back then. Wojnarowicz describes a nightmarish drive with the emaciated, furious Hujar to Long Island to visit a doctor who claims to have had good results with typhoid shots. He isn’t really a doctor, it turns out, though his waiting room is filled with dozens of desperate Aids patients.

Hujar died on 26 November 1987. Unflinching as ever, Wojnarowicz recorded his passing, standing by his body to take 23 photographs of “his amazing feet, his head, that open eye again”, before raising his hands in helplessness and breaking down. 

Ragged with grief, he was plunged into a deep confrontation with mortality, especially after his own diagnosis a few months later. As a young man, he had often engaged in self-destructive behaviour, dabbling with heroin, treating himself with reckless disregard. Now he wanted to grapple with those dark impulses, to understand their cause.

In the final, gargantuan essay, “The Suicide of a Guy Who Once Built an Elaborate Shrine Over a Mouse Hole”, he investigates the suicide of a friend, mixing his own reflections with interviews with members of their shared circle. Again, the writing is extraordinary: a full-bore, high-stakes facing up to death. It closes with an unsparing description of a bullfight in Mérida, Mexico. An incantation repeats like a tolling bell: “Smell the flowers while you can.” It sounds simple, until you remember the many forces geared against health and love, the courage it took to commit to pleasure.

Of all the many voices from the margins, Wojnarowicz is among the most commanding, writing at a pitch of white-hot urgency. And yet Close to the Knives is not simply a diatribe, let alone anything resembling dry political analysis. Instead, it is a kind of intensely alive hybrid: a work of radical honesty that uses the most intimate of experiences, particularly sexual, as a way of prying open the devastating way in which political systems work to exclude and silence the unwanted.

“It is exhausting, living in a population where people don’t speak up if what they witness doesn’t directly threaten them,” he writes. Long before the word intersectionality was in common currency, Wojnarowicz was alert to people whose experience was erased by what he called “the pre‑invented world” or “the one-tribe nation”. Politicised by his own sexuality, by the violence and deprivation he had been subjected to, he developed a deep empathy with others, a passionate investment in diversity. During the course of Knives he touches repeatedly on other struggles, from fighting police brutality towards people of colour to standing up to the erosion of abortion rights.

It is 24 years since Wojnarowicz died, and yet his struggle has lost none of its relevance. We might like to think that the world he documented ended with combination therapy, or with marriage equality, or with any of the other liberal victories of the last two decades. But the forces he spoke out against are as lively and malevolent as ever. Even his old enemies are back in fashion.

Ted Cruz is on record praising the late senator Jesse Helms, a civil rights opposer dedicated to fighting federal funding for work by gay artists (Wojnarowicz was a particular target). As for Hillary Clinton, she provoked a furore at Nancy Reagan’s funeral by celebrating the Reagans for starting a national conversation on Aids, “when, before, nobody would talk about it”. As if. In fact, the Reagan administration was notable for its long refusal to mention the issue of Aids, a silence that had appalling consequences.

As the rallying cry of Aids activists made clear, “Silence = Death”. From the very beginning of his life Wojnarowicz had been subjected to an enforced silencing, first by his father and then by the society he inhabited: the media that erased him; the courts that legislated against him; and the politicians who considered his life and the lives of those he loved expendable.

In Knives he repeatedly explains his motivation for making art as an acute desire to produce objects that could speak, testifying to his presence when he no longer could. “To place an object or piece of writing that contains what is invisible because of legislation or social taboo into an environment outside myself makes me feel not so alone,” he writes. “It is kind of like a ventriloquist’s dummy – the only difference is that the work can speak by itself or act like that magnet to attract others who carried this enforced silence.”

Clinton apologised for her statement at Nancy Reagan’s funeral, but that didn’t entirely quell the anger. Within hours of her comment, a photograph began to circulate on social media. It showed a lanky man from behind, wearing a denim jacket hand-painted with a pink triangle and the words “IF I DIE OF AIDS – FORGET BURIAL – JUST DROP MY BODY ON THE STEPS OF THE FDA” (the US Food and Drug Administration, then dragging their feet over Aids research).

It was Wojnarowicz, of course: still finding new ways to be heard, to counter untruths. If silence equals death, he taught us, then art equals language equals life."
96,snopes12,0,https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/what-muellers-indictment-reveals-about-russias-internet-research-agency,What Muellers Indictment Reveals About Russias Internet Research Agency,"According to U.S. intelligence agencies, the Russian effort to interfere in the 2016 Presidential election had two prongs. One was the hacking and leaking of e-mails from the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clintons campaign chairman, John Podesta. The second was a campaign of misinformation and propaganda carried out largely over social media. The charges that the special counsel, Robert Mueller, issued on Friday concern solely the second prong. The indictment names thirteen Russians, twelve of whom worked for a shadowy, Kremlin-connected outfit called the Internet Research Agency. The Agency has been linked to a campaign of online disinformation that included the creation of hundreds of fake political pages on Facebook and accounts on Twitter that were presented as belonging to everyday Americans; during the election, according to the indictment, this disinformation campaign was aimed at boosting Donald Trump, undermining Hillary Clinton, and sowing general political discord in the United States by supporting radical causes on both sides. It was sort of like a cutting-edge social-media marketing operation run, as the indictment alleges, by a St. Petersburg-based oligarch named Yevgeny Prigozhin.

Much of the information in the indictment isnt new. The Agency was first noticed by Russian media outlets in 2014, when it was dedicated mainly to spreading online propaganda in support of pro-Russian separatists in the Ukraine conflict. In the spring of 2015, when the idea of a President Donald Trump was still a laughable fantasy, I travelled to St. Petersburg to investigate the Agency, which had recently started experimenting with targeting audiences outside Russia. As I conducted my reporting, I was myself the target of an elaborate smear campaign to label me a neo-Nazi sympathizer and U.S. intelligence agentan early use of the kind of bizarre tactics that have been documented by numerous investigations in both the Russian and Western media, and by the internal investigations of social-media companies.

Yet the new indictment offers the most complete look yet at the Agencys internal workings. Muellers investigators discovered that the Agency used a network of shell companiesentities with names like MediaSintez LLC, GlavSet LLC, and MixInfo LLCto hide its activities and funding. The indictment alleges that the Agency employed hundreds of workers, and that by September, 2016, it had a monthly budget of more than $1.25 million. The document details how the Agencys specialists worked in day and night shifts, and the way they were constantly trying to measure the effect of their efforts. The employees ran fake conservative Twitter and Facebook accounts, and even planned (sparsely attended) real-life rallies.

The indictment also reveals previously unknown efforts that the Agency made to gather intelligence, both online and on the ground, to bolster its campaign. Agency employees assumed false identities and exchanged messages with real American political activists, who offered them tips, such as focussing on purple states like Colorado, Virginia, and Florida. At one point, two Internet Research Agency employees travelled to the U.S.passing through the states of Nevada, Michigan, Louisiana, Texas, and New Yorkto gather intelligence.

Back in 2016, I noticed that many of the Agency accounts I had uncovered in my investigation were tweeting pro-Trump content. According to the indictment, one memo distributed by Agency managers instructed employees to use any opportunity to criticize Hillary and the rest (except Sanders and Trump--we support them.) After an internal Agency review determined that a Facebook page called Secured Borders was not posting enough content critical of Clinton, an order went out saying that it is imperative to intensify criticizing Hillary Clinton in future posts.

Yet the indictment does not shed light on the extent to which the Kremlin and, specifically, the Russian President, Vladimir Putin, were involved in the Agencys work. Nor does the indictment move us any closer to a conclusion regarding whether anyone in the Trump campaign colluded with the Russian operation. The chain of command as detailed by the indictment stops at Prigozhin, who has long been identified as the chief architect of the Agency. The Times has identified Prigozhin as Putins go-to oligarch for a variety of sensitive and often-unsavory missions, like recruiting contract soldiers to fight in Ukraine and Syria. Yet Muellers new indictment does not claim that Putin personally ordered the Agency to turn into a pro-Trump propaganda machine. When I was reporting on the Agency, some sources suggested to me that it was a project undertaken independently, in order to curry favor with Putin.

None of the Russians named in the indictment face the prospect of testifying before an American jury anytime soon. And, with the 2018 midterms approaching, one question is to what extent the Internet Research Agency is still operating. Reports about the Agency, stoked by fearmongering information warfare experts, have created as much paranoia as the original disinformation campaign. The kind of clarity offered in Muellers indictment would be useful in understanding the structure and scope of Russian trolling activities today."

Desiree Ali-Fairooz was scheduled to stand for her second trial on Nov. 13 after being arrested for what appeared to be laughing during Attorney General Jeff Sessions' confirmation hearing in January. Ali-Fairooz tweeted she had received notice that her case was being dropped on Monday afternoon.

Ali-Fairooz, an activist with the organization Code Pink, was convicted of disrupting Congress when she let out a laugh while reacting to Alabama Sen. Richard Shelby that Sessions’ record of ""treating all Americans equally under the law is clear and well-documented."" She was found guilty in May, and was told she faced up to six months in jail.

In July, Chief Judge Robert E. Morin of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia tossed the verdict, and scheduled a re-trial saying that the government had wrongly argued that a laugh alone was sufficient cause for the verdict.

Ali-Fairooz's arresting officer, Katherine Coronado, was in her second week on the job during Sessions' confirmation hearing, and at the time had never conducted an arrest, nor worked a congressional hearing, HuffPost reported."

Sessions made the comments in an interview with ""The Mark Levin Show"" Tuesday evening that was put online Wednesday.
9th Circuit will hear travel ban suit in May
""We've got cases moving in the very, very liberal Ninth Circuit, who, they've been hostile to the order,"" Sessions said. ""We won a case in Virginia recently that was a nicely-written order that just demolished, I thought, all the arguments that some of the other people have been making. We are confident that the President will prevail on appeal and particularly in the Supreme Court, if not the Ninth Circuit. So this is a huge matter. I really am amazed that a judge sitting on an island in the Pacific can issue an order that stops the President of the United States from what appears to be clearly his statutory and Constitutional power.""
Last month, a federal judge in Hawaii, Judge Derrick Watson, issued an order that blocked Trump's ban on travelers from several Muslim-majority countries. The Department of Justice is currently appealing the decision.


In tweets on Thursday, both Senators from Hawaii responded to Sessions' comments

Justice Department spokesperson Ian D. Prior clarified Sessions' remarks in a statement on Thursday.
""Hawaii is, in fact, an island in the Pacific -- a beautiful one where the Attorney General's granddaughter was born,"" he said. ""The point, however, is that there is a problem when a flawed opinion by a single judge can block the President's lawful exercise of authority to keep the entire country safe.""

In the interview on Tuesday, Sessions also added that judges shouldn't ""psychoanalyze"" Trump when he was asked about potential judges Trump would appoint.
""I think our President, having seen some of these really weird interpretations of the executive orders that he's put out, I think he's more understanding now that we need judges who follow the law, not make law,"" Sessions said.
""The judges don't get to psychoanalyze the President to see if the order he issues is lawful. It's either lawful or it's not. I think that it will be real important for America to have judges in the model of Judge (Neil) Gorsuch and (the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin) Scalia, people who serve under the law, under the Constitution, not above it, and they are faithful to the law. They honor it and don't try to remake it as they'd like it to be.""

99,snopes122,0,https://abcnews.go.com/US/trump-admin-reverse-ban-elephant-trophies-africa/story?id=51178663,Trump admin. to reverse ban on elephant trophies from Africa,"The Trump administration plans to allow hunters to bring trophies of elephants they killed in Zimbabwe and Zambia back to the United States, reversing a ban put in place by the Obama administration in 2014, a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service official confirmed for ABC News today.

Even though elephants are listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act, a provision in the act allows the government to give permits to import such trophies if there is evidence that the hunting benefits conservation for that species. The official said the administration has new information from officials in Zimbabwe and Zambia to support reversing the ban.

""Legal, well-regulated sport hunting as part of a sound management program can benefit the conservation of certain species by providing incentives to local communities to conserve the species and by putting much-needed revenue back into conservation,"" a Fish and Wildlife spokesperson said in a statement.

This change applies only to elephants in those two countries. It prompted questions about using game hunting to generate money for conservation efforts, and similar questions arose after the controversial killing of Cecil the lion in Zimbabwe in 2015.

The government has not officially announced this policy change yet, but it was reportedly raised at a wildlife forum in South Africa this week, according to Safari Club International, which filed a lawsuit to block the 2014 ban.

It's unclear how the current political situation in Zimbabwe could affect this decision, but a blog post from the president of the Humane Society of the United States points out that poaching has been a problem in Zimbabwe over the years and that the hunting industry there faces corruption issues.

A notice regarding this reversal will be posted in the Federal Register on Friday with specifics on the new information justifying the change.

The permits will apply to elephants hunted in Zimbabwe from Jan. 21, 2016, to Dec. 31, 2018, and elephants hunted in Zambia during 2016, 2017 and 2018 for applications that meet all other applicable requirements, according to the Fish and Wildlife spokesperson.

Savanna elephant populations declined by 30 percent across 18 countries in Africa from 2007 to 2014, according to the Great Elephant Census published last year, which put their remaining numbers at just over 350,000.

The elephant population declined 6 percent overall in Zimbabwe but dropped by 74 percent within one specific region. Elephants saw ""substantial declines along the Zambezi River,"" in Zambia while other areas of that country were stable, according to the census.
The Fish and Wildlife Service has been talking with wildlife officials in Zimbabwe since the ban was announced in 2014. Since then, Zimbabwe officials have stepped up efforts to combat poaching, established a system to report financial benefit from American hunters and provided more information on how officials establish hunting quotas, according to the text of the federal register notice that will be posted Friday.

The census reported about 82,000 elephants in Zimbabwe. Wildlife officials set annual quotas limiting hunting there to 500 elephants in different areas.

Elephant hunting has been banned in Zambia several times over the years because of declining population but was re-established in 2015 after surveys found a larger population in some areas. Zambia is home to some 22,000 elephants, according to the census.

Tourists may hunt elephants on private game ranches or specified areas in Zambia, many of which are on the outskirts of national parks. Zambian officials carry out anti-poaching efforts and manage elephant hunting through permits and quotas, according to the Federal Register notice. In 2016, 30 elephants were allowed to be killed there as trophies, but the government reported that only 12 males were killed, according to the notice.

Fees paid by hunters are used to fund the country's conservation efforts."
100,snopes123,0,https://www.adn.com/nation-world/2017/03/21/roger-stone-the-trickster-on-trumps-side-is-under-fbi-scrutiny/,"Roger Stone, the 'trickster' on Trump's side, is under FBI scrutiny","In President Donald Trump's oft-changing world order, Roger J. Stone Jr., the onetime political consultant and full-time provocateur, has been one of the few constants — a loyalist and self-proclaimed ""dirty trickster"" who nurtured the dream of a presidential run by the developer-turned-television-star for 30 years.

But two months into the Trump presidency, Stone, known for his pinstripe suits, the Nixon tattoo spanning his shoulder blades, and decades of outlandish statements, is under investigation for what would be his dirtiest trick — colluding with the Russians to defeat Hillary Clinton and put his friend in the White House.

At a hearing of the House Intelligence Committee Monday, Democrats pressed James B. Comey, director of the FBI, for information on Stone. Asked by Rep. Adam B. Schiff, D-Calif., if he was familiar with Stone, Comey replied tersely, ""Generally, yes,"" before saying he could not discuss any specific person.

Stone, 64, is the best known of the Trump associates under scrutiny as part of an FBI investigation into Russian interference in the election. John D. Podesta, the Clinton campaign chairman whose hacked emails were released by WikiLeaks, accused him in October of having advance warning of the hacks, which the intelligence community has concluded were orchestrated by Russia.

""Trust me, it will soon the Podesta's time in the barrel,"" Stone had mused on Twitter before Podesta's emails were released.

When Schiff asked Comey at the House hearing how Stone could have known that Podesta's emails were going to be released, the FBI director again refused to answer. ""That's not something I can comment on,"" Comey replied.

Stone has denied advance knowledge of the hacks or any involvement with the Russians. But his public statements have given investigators something to focus on.

Before the Podesta emails were released, Stone said in a speech that he had ""communicated with"" Julian Assange, the WikiLeaks founder — whom he has defended for years — and that he had a large trove of material on the Clintons that he would publish shortly before the election. He has acknowledged having communicated over Twitter with the online persona Guccifer 2.0, who U.S. officials believe is a front for Russian intelligence officials. And there was the Podesta tweet.

Stone has explanations for reach: The timeline of his ""benign"" contacts with Guccifer 2.0 — ""who may or not be a Russian asset"" — disproves claims of collusion; his communication with Assange was through an intermediary and was ""perfectly legal;"" and the Podesta tweet referred to information in an article he wrote that appeared two months later, not any emails.

Now under scrutiny by both FBI and Senate investigators, Stone has hired two lawyers to represent him. But in an interview, Stone maintained that this was ""a scandal with no evidence.""

""There is still not an iota of proof that anyone on the Trump campaign colluded with the Russians,"" said Stone, who met Trump through their mutual mentor, the McCarthy-era fixer and lawyer Roy M. Cohn.

Stone learned from Cohn that all press is good press, and to hit back, hard and often, and he is doing just that.

His recent book, ""The Making of the President 2016,"" is part paean to Trump and part pushback against the claims related to Russia. While promoting the book, Stone has said he believes his communications were monitored by the government, and he supports Trump's contention that there must have been surveillance of him as a candidate.

His own writings mirror, and perhaps feed into, Trump's belief that there is a broad intelligence community effort to undermine the current White House. He tweeted in protest of ""smears"" that he wanted to respond to during Monday's hearing.

Few people go as far back with Trump as Stone. Over the years, he was by Trump's side as he toyed with running for president and then, in 2015, finally decided to do it. But he seems to prefer the role of outside adviser in a relationship that has had many ups and downs. It was the role he played in 2016 after he left Trump's campaign over what Stone said was a fight about its direction.

Stone said he decided to leave; Trump maintained that he fired him.

As an informal adviser, Stone supported Trump's plan to focus extensively on immigration at the start of the 2016 campaign and believed that he could tap into a core group of disaffected Republican voters. He encouraged his engagement with conservative online media, such as Newsmax and, later on, Breitbart. He also advised Trump to attack Clinton over how she dealt with women involved in her husband's extramarital affairs, a line of attack that Trump embraced. Trump offered praise for Stone on the coming Netflix documentary ""Get Me Roger Stone.""

These days, he will not discuss how frequently he is in touch with Trump or whether he has visited the Oval Office since the inauguration — which he attended dressed according to what he described as ""proper etiquette"": a top hat and morning suit. The White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, told reporters in the briefing room Monday that Trump and Stone speak ""from time to time,"" and he contended they had not done so recently.

To both his allies and critics, Stone, a native of Connecticut, presents a contradictory portrait. His name inspired anxiety in a generation of New York political operatives. He has embraced theories that Trump pushed in the campaign about Sen. Ted Cruz's father somehow being tied to the John F. Kennedy assassination. And once a week he guest-hosts on a radio show hosted by Alex Jones, who has a devoted following of Trump voters along with a raft of conspiracy theories of his own.

On Monday, when he devoted most of his show to defending Stone, Jones expressed concern that Stone's life was in danger — a reference to Stone's claim that he was recently poisoned with polonium as well as the victim of a ""suspicious"" hit-and-run broadside car crash last week. Stone did not let that keep him from an event in Orlando to promote his book the following day.

But Stone is also a libertarian and a strong supporter of gay rights and legalized marijuana who expressed concern in 2016 that Trump's campaign team didn't try harder to get him to disavow the Ku Klux Klan leader, David Duke. While he has long been an outlier in the political world, he got his real start in national politics with the Reagan campaign in 1979. He is renowned among Republican political professionals for using the internet for years before any mainstream Republicans or activists, according to Tony Fabrizio, a veteran Republican pollster.

And for a time, as a partner in a white-shoe Washington lobbying firm, Stone was a part of the swamp that Trump now wants to drain. He worked there with his old friend, Paul Manafort, who was Trump's campaign chairman. His ties to Russia are now under scrutiny by the FBI, but Manafort denies any suggestion that he colluded with Russian officials or anybody else.

But those establishment days seem far in the past. As scrutiny of him has intensified in recent weeks, Stone has lashed out more aggressively, sending a series of caustic, obscenity-laced messages on Twitter, several of which he deleted a few hours after posting.

""Don't confuse Roger Stone with the character I play,"" Stone said with a chuckle in an interview Sunday, conceding that he has sometimes sent a ""two-martini tweet."""
101,snopes124,0,https://apnews.com/article/dad0588ebf2349d8a63a463acca71860,Report: Trump’s grandfather pleaded to stay in Germany,"BERLIN (AP) — A handwritten letter has been found in a German archive in which President-elect Donald Trump’s grandfather unsuccessfully fought his expulsion from the country for failing to perform mandatory military service.

Bild newspaper on Monday printed the 1905 letter located by an historian, in which Friedrich Trump wrote Bavarian Prince Luitpold begging the “well-loved, noble, wise and just” leader not to deport him. Luitpold rejected the “most subservient request.”

Trump’s grandfather was born in Kallstadt, then part of Bavaria, and immigrated to the U.S. as a teenager without performing his military service. It was after he’d made his fortune there and tried to resettle in Germany that he was ordered expelled, and returned to the U.S.

Rhineland-Palatinate state archive spokeswoman Isabell Weisbrod says Friedrich Trump’s birth certificate’s also in the archive."

The Russian ship was in international waters, 70 miles off the coast of Delaware and heading north at 10 knots, according to one official. The U.S. territory line is 12 nautical miles.

It was not immediately clear where the ship is headed.

Later Tuesday, a U.S. official confirmed to Fox News that Russia had deployed ground-launched cruise missiles to two locations inside the country in December. The New York Times first reported that the Obama administration had previously seen the missiles -- then in a testing phase -- as a violation of a 1987 treaty between the U.S. and Russia that banned ground-launched intermediate-range missiles.

But Russia has pressed ahead with its program, apparently testing a Trump administration which has sought better ties with Moscow -- but is also fresh off the loss of National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, who resigned Monday night in the wake of a scandal surrounding his communications with Russia.

Adding to the aggressive actions, Fox News confirmed a report from The Washington Free Beacon that four Russian jets buzzed the USS Porter in the Black Sea on Friday. The destroyer was roughly 186 miles southwest of Crimea and roughly 50 miles off the coast of Romania, a U.S. official said.

The jets buzzed the destroyer over course of “several hours,” the official said without specifying. A Russian IL-38 maritime patrol aircraft came in first, followed by two Su-24 attack jets, and then a single Su-24.

All approached “low and fast,” the official added, saying the ship was conducting “routine operations in international waters.”

The USS Porter made repeated radio calls to the Russian jets, but the calls were ignored. The jets had their transponders turned off, the official said.


""There were several incidents involving multiple Russian aircraft,"" Navy Capt. Danny Hernandez, spokesman for the European Command, told The Free Beacon. ""They were assessed by the commanding officer as unsafe and unprofessional.""

The ship, the SSV-175 Viktor Leonov, last sailed near the U.S. in April 2015, an official said. It was also seen in Havana in January 2015.

Capable of intercepting communications or signals, known as SIGINT, the ship can also measure U.S. Navy sonar capabilities, a separate official said.

The Russian spy ship is also armed with surface-to-air missiles.

“It’s not a huge concern, but we are keeping our eyes on it,” one official said.

This action by the Russian military follows recent missile test launches by Iran and North Korea.

In the past, Russian spy ships have loitered off the coast of Kings Bay, Ga., home to a U.S. Navy ballistic missile submarine base. During the Cold War, Russian intelligence gathering ships routinely parked off U.S. submarine bases along the East Coast

In September 2015, another Russian spy ship was spotted near the U.S. outside the submarine base in Kings Bay.

Outside of U.S. intelligence gathering satellites monitoring the Russian spy ship’s voyage north, there are several airborne platforms along the East Coast that could be used by the U.S. military to monitor the Russian ship, according to one official.

Currently there are four U.S. Navy warships in the Atlantic off the coast of Norfolk participating in normal training, but none have been tasked with shadowing the Russian spy ship.

There are no U.S. Navy aircraft carriers nearby.

The USS Eisenhower, an aircraft carrier, is currently off the coast of Florida doing carrier qualifications, with young pilots making their first landings. Ike does not currently have strike aircraft.

Last April, Russian Su-24s buzzed the USS Donald Cook in the Baltic Sea flying as low as 30 feet above the ocean and coming very close to the American warship.

The Viktor Leonov SSV-175, part of the Vishnya class of intelligence ships, quietly entered Cuban waters earlier this week and was docked at a cruise ship terminal on Thursday, its crew casually taking in the view of the old colonial section of the Cuban capital as passers-by gawked.

Russian warships have come and gone in Cuba since the collapse of the Soviet Union, usually with much publicity and the opportunity for Cubans to visit the ship. This time there was no mention in the Cuban state-run media.

Russia has been stung by recent unrest in Ukraine, where a pro-Russian government was ousted in favor of one seeking an alliance with the West, and where Russia has a major naval base near Sevastopol on the Black Sea.

Russia on Wednesday put 150,000 troops on high alert in Central and Western Russia, including areas bordering Ukraine, in a show of strength. Moscow denied the drill was linked to events in Ukraine.

On Wednesday in Moscow, Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said Russia planned to increase its military projection abroad, including in Cuba, Venezuela and Nicaragua.

The Russian Navy intelligence vessel in Havana was commissioned by the Soviet Union in 1988 near the end of the Cold War, outfitted with electronic surveillance equipment and missile defense systems and is a signals intelligence asset of the Russian Navy, according to the Russian government.

The 94-meter (309-foot) ship was receiving food, but no maintenance or fuel, port employees said.

A Russian embassy official described the visit as “friendly,” saying members of the crew joined Havana officials in laying a wreath at a monument to Soviet soldiers.

“It was scheduled to stay three or four days. It should leave tomorrow,” said the embassy spokesman, who declined to identify himself.

The former Soviet Union and communist-run Cuba were close allies for decades, and the Soviets built a major intelligence base on the outskirts of Havana that was closed soon after the demise of European communism.

During the recent Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia, two U.S. ships including the USS Mount Whitney sailed into the Black Sea as part of U.S. security measures."

On that day, SpaceX and Elon Musk will launch a lethal pathogen into space and deliver it to the International Space Station. The pathogen is called methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, also known as MRSA, and causes very frequent and difficult-to-treat infections in hospitalized patients. One of the main clinical concerns is that this superbug is rapidly becoming resistant to most currently available antibiotics. Simply put, the pathogen is lethal and it's going to take a grand effort to stop it. And that just might include space travel!

After launch and once MRSA is on board, it will be used in a fascinating study to examine the impact of near-zero gravity on gene expression and mutation patterns. The study is sponsored by NASA and CASIS and will be led by Anita Goel, M.D., Ph.D. Dr. Goel is the the Chairman and CEO of Nanobiosym, who was awarded the first XPRIZE in Healthcare for the Gene-RADAR technology—the world’s first mobile Tricorder device that enables real-time diagnosis of any disease with a genetic fingerprint at a cost at least 10 times cheaper than comparable diagnostic tests on the market today. Dr. Goel is a world-renowned expert and pioneer in the emerging field of nanobiophysics—a new science at the convergence of physics, nanotechnology and biomedicine. She has been expanding conventional theoretical physics frameworks and their mathematical machinery to describe non-equilibrium, open systems such as life and living systems that are strongly coupled with their environment. It's her  hypothesis that the near-zero gravity environment could result in accelerated mutation rates of MRSA. In other words, we can press the ""fast forward"" button and get a sneak peak at mutation patterns that have not yet occurred on earth.

Our work in micorgravity on International Space Station is both very practical and fundamental. We are pushing the envelope of personalized, precision medicine, enabling better prediction of drug resistance and hence smarter drugs. On a fundamental science level, I am keen to test my 20 year old hypothesis that the environment can deeply influence the information flow from both the genome and transcriptome.

The implications for medicine and drug development are tremendous. Current antimicrobial therapies are often ineffective, and the emergence of resistance can only be observed in real time or retrospectively. So treating infections is often a ""catch-up"" scenario where pathogens can be elusive and have the upper hand. Goel and her team plan to leverage the unique environment in space to observe the activity of MRSA—from gene expression to mutations—to provide insights into what might happen back on earth.

Sanders came out swinging as soon as he got the chance to speak. Here was his opening exchange with DeVos:

Sanders: “Mrs. DeVos, there is a growing fear, I think, in this country that we are moving toward what some would call an oligarchic form of society, where a small number of very, very wealthy billionaires control, to a significant degree, our economic and political life. Would you be so kind as to tell us how much your family has contributed to the Republican Party over the years?”

DeVos: “Senator, first of all thank you for that question. I again was pleased to meet you in your office last week. I wish I could give you that number. I don’t know.”

Sanders: “I have heard the number was $200 million. Does that sound in the ballpark?”

DeVos: “Collectively? Between my entire family?”

Sanders: “Yeah, over the years.”

DeVos: “That’s possible”

Sanders: “Okay. My question is, and I don’t mean to be rude. Do you think, if you were not a multi-billionaire, if your family has not made hundreds of millions of dollars of contributions to the Republican Party, that you would be sitting here today?”

DeVos: “Senator, as a matter of fact, I do think that there would be that possibility. I’ve worked very hard on behalf of parents and children for the last almost 30 years to be a voice for students and to empower parents to make decisions on behalf of their children, primarily low-income children.”

Senator Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) got his chance to speak afterwards and offered a veiled criticism of Sanders' line of questioning. “Unlike others here who may be interested in attacking your donations,"" Hatch said, ""I know that you want to do right by all children, so I will stick to focusing on how we can work together on sound policy.”

Senator Susan Collins (R-Maine) also criticized Sanders. “I have no doubt that you care deeply about the education of all children,"" she told DeVos. ""Given your lifelong work and commitment to education, any suggestion, such as was made earlier, that your nomination is linked to your political contributions is really unfair and unwarranted.”"
106,snopes129,0,https://www.politico.com/story/2016/12/betsy-devos-donor-senators-232792,DeVos heads into confirmation with a megadonor's advantage,"Billionaire Betsy DeVos has been unabashed about using her wealth to advance her own agenda. “We expect a return on our investment,” she once wrote about her family’s massive political contributions.

After giving millions of dollars to politicians over the past two decades, she now heads into her Senate confirmation hearing for education secretary with a clear advantage: DeVos and her husband, Dick, have donated to the campaigns of 17 senators who will consider her nomination — four of whom sit on the Senate education committee that oversees the process.

Big donors often get plum government jobs. But DeVos’ contributions to the lawmakers who will decide her fate stand out in a year in which President-elect Donald Trump has pledged to “drain the swamp” of Washington politics.

Education committee members Sens. Richard Burr (R-N.C.), Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), Bill Cassidy (R-La.) and Tim Scott (R-S.C.) have all accepted money — collectively, $50,000 — from DeVos and her husband since 2010. In that same time period, the couple contributed a total of more than $160,000 to senators who will consider Betsy DeVos’ nomination, including Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.).

“It’s just another reflection of the distortion of our politics due to massive campaign contributions,” said Robert Weissman, president of the watchdog group Public Citizen, who said he finds DeVos’ political contributions troubling. “People who receive campaign contributions from her are far less likely to scrutinize her than people who have not.”

DeVos and her husband together made about $2.7 million in political contributions in 2016, including donations to Republican Senate leadership PACs, according to an analysis by the Center for Responsive Politics.

Over the past two and half decades, the couple donated more than $7.7 million to Republican candidates and parties across the country, the analysis found. The center also examined donations by DeVos’ entire extended family, and found more than $20 million in contributions to Republican candidates, party committees, PACs and super PACs since 1989.

Writing in a 1997 Roll Call op-ed, DeVos defended her family’s political contributions and said she expects politicians to champion her causes after receiving financial support. She wrote that she hoped Republican candidates would use her family’s contributions to advance a “conservative governing philosophy consisting of limited government and respect for traditional American virtues.”

Asked about DeVos’ political donations, Scott suggested that plenty of President Barack Obama’s nominees had given money to Democrats.

“I would love to see the list of Obama appointees and who they donated to,” he said.

Scott described himself as a big fan of DeVos’ views on education, and the South Carolina senator previously spoke at an aviation-themed charter school in Michigan that DeVos and her husband help fund. “Her commitment to education is to make sure America has the best-educated children in the world,” he said, praising her efforts to push a “school choice” agenda that’s built around the growth of charter schools and voucher programs that allow taxpayer money to flow to private schools, including religious schools.

“If you're going to address the issues of quality education, you should address those issues for kids, and not for unions,"" he said.

Karina Petersen, a spokeswoman for Murkowski, said that her Senate office doesn’t “follow what contributions are made to Sen. Murkowski’s campaign, nor do we take them into account when considering an issue, or taking official action in the U.S. Senate.” Murkowski, she said, would “closely examine the merits” of each Trump nominee “before arriving at a final decision.”

Sens. Cassidy and Burr did not respond to requests for comment.

Through a spokesperson, DeVos declined to comment for this story.

The members of Congress who have received money from DeVos have often been prominent proponents of school choice legislation, such as the D.C. school voucher program, which allows low-income students to use federal money to enroll in private schools, including religious schools. DeVos has made the program a priority of her organization, the American Federation for Children.

DeVos’ relationship with some senators extends beyond political donations. Scott, for example, has spoken at conferences held by the AFC, whose board DeVos chaired until Trump tapped her last month to be his education secretary. Sen. Cory Booker, a New Jersey Democrat, hasn’t accepted money from the DeVoses, but also has a longstanding relationship with their organization, and has spoken at its events. He said last week that he has some “serious early concerns” about DeVos’ nomination. “Like all of Trump’s nominees, I will approach her nomination with deep scrutiny, especially because I am alarmed by President-elect Trump’s overall education agenda and fear that he has little respect for — or interest in — the critical work that the Department of Education performs for our children.”

Senate education committee Chairman Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), who isn’t listed among the donation recipients, downplayed the effect that DeVos’ giving will have on the confirmation process.

“All of that is disclosed,” Alexander said. “You can ask those senators and evaluate it yourself. That’s the reason we have limits on campaign contributions and we have disclosures of those things.”

Republicans have been largely unified in their support for DeVos, a billionaire philanthropist and education activist. And while Democrats have indicated they plan to question DeVos’ support for public education and her lack of traditional education experience, such as working as a teacher or school administrator, they have been less interested in going after her political donations to members of Congress.

Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), a member of the Senate education committee, has been critical of DeVos but said he doesn’t worry about her political donations.

“It wouldn’t be the first time that a nominee has made political donations,” he said. “Penny Pritzker was a fantastic secretary of commerce, and she probably made a few donations to Democrats over the years. I don’t worry about those donations.”

But DeVos’ role as a Republican mega-donor could still emerge as an issue in the upcoming confirmation hearings.

A senior aide to a Democrat on the Senate education committee said she has spent money for years to advance what the staffer described as ""her anti-public education agenda."" ""So there will certainly be interest into whether she's continued this pattern with her own nomination,"" the staffer said.

DeVos twice chaired the state Republican Party in Michigan and also worked for two years as a finance chair of the National Republican Senatorial Committee during the George W. Bush administration.

Aside from boosting Republican candidates nationally, DeVos and her husband have also poured millions into advocating for a conservative education agenda. In Michigan, where the DeVoses have contributed at least $7 million to the state party and lawmakers, the powerful couple have influenced nearly every major piece of education-related legislation since the 1990s."

""It's a complete urban legend,"" said state wildlife biologist Thomas McDonough. ""I think it blew out of proportion based on a Disney documentary in the '50s, and that brought it to the mainstream.""

Lemmings are a kind of short tailed vole, a mouse-like rodent that favors tundra and open grasslands. Three kinds are found in Alaska, including the collared lemming, the only rodent that turns white in winter.

In 1958 Walt Disney produced ""White Wilderness,"" part of the studio's ""True Life Adventure"" series. ""White Wilderness"" featured a segment on lemmings, detailing their strange compulsion to commit mass suicide.

According to a 1983 investigation by Canadian Broadcasting Corporation producer Brian Vallee, the lemming scenes were faked. The lemmings supposedly committing mass suicide by leaping into the ocean were actually thrown off a cliff by the Disney filmmakers. The epic ""lemming migration"" was staged using careful editing, tight camera angles and a few dozen lemmings running on snow covered lazy-Susan style turntable.

""White Wilderness"" was filmed in Alberta, Canada, a landlocked province, and not on location in lemmings' natural habitat. There are about 20 lemming species found in the circumpolar north - but evidently not in that area of Alberta. So the Disney people bought lemmings from Inuit children a couple provinces away in Manitoba and staged the whole sequence.

In the lemming segment, the little rodents assemble for a mass migration, scamper across the tundra and ford a tiny stream as narrator Winston Hibbler explains that, ""A kind of compulsion seizes each tiny rodent and, carried along by an unreasoning hysteria, each falls into step for a march that will take them to a strange destiny.""

That destiny is to jump into the ocean. As they approach the ""sea,"" (actually a river -more tight cropping) Hibbler continues, ""They've become victims of an obsession -- a one-track thought: Move on! Move on!""

The ""pack of lemmings"" reaches the final precipice. ""This is the last chance to turn back,"" Hibbler states. ""Yet over they go, casting themselves out bodily into space.""

Life-loving lemming: lemmings do not commit mass suicide, although in lean times they may become cannibalistic. These mouse-like rodents are found in Alaska and in northern countries around the world, mostly favoring tundra and open grassland.

Lemmings are seen flying into the water. The final shot shows the sea awash with dying lemmings.

Certainly, some scenes in nature documentaries are staged. In Sir David Attenborough's recent documentary, ""The Life of Birds,"" the close-up footage of a flying duck, filmed razor-sharp from the bird's wingtip, was shot from a car using a mallard drake trained to fly alongside the car. But faking an entirely mythical event is something else.

""Disney had to have gotten that idea from somewhere,"" said Thomas McDonough, the state wildlife biologist. Disney likely confused dispersal with migration, he added, and embellished a kernel of truth.

Lemming populations fluctuate enormously based on predators, food, climate and other factors. Under ideal conditions, in a single year a population of voles can increase by a factor of ten. When they've exhausted the local food supply, they disperse, as do moose, beaver and many other animals.

Lemmings can swim and will cross bodies of water in their quest for greener pastures. Sometimes they drown. Dispersal and accidental death is a far cry from the instinctive, deliberate mass suicide depicted in ""White Wilderness,"" but Hibbler explains that life is tough in the lemmings' ""weird world of frozen chaos."" The voice-over implies that lemmings take the plunge every seven to ten years to alleviate overpopulation.

""What people see is essentially mass dispersal,"" said zoologist Gordon Jarrell, an expert in small mammals with the University of Alaska Fairbanks. ""Sometimes it's pretty directional. The classic example is in the Scandinavian mountains, where (lemmings) have been dramatically observed. They will come to a body of water and be temporarily stopped, and eventually they'll build up along the shore so dense and they will swim across. If they get wet to the skin, they 're essentially dead.""

""There's no question that at times they will build up to huge numbers,"" Jarrell added. ""One description from Barrow does talk about them drowning and piling up on the shore.""

Jarrell said when people learn that he works with lemmings, the mass suicide issue often comes up.

""It's a frequent question,"" he said ""'Do they really kill themselves?' No. The answer is unequivocal, no they don't.""

108,snopes130,0,https://edition.cnn.com/2017/01/06/politics/supreme-court-wars-escalate/index.html,Supreme Court wars escalate,"The Supreme Court wars escalated this week when Democrats signaled they are ready to fight for the seat they believe should have gone to Merrick Garland, and already the prospect of the nuclear option is being discussed.

""Let's see who they nominate,"" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Wednesday to reporters. ""If they're in the mainstream we'll give them a very careful look. If they're out of the mainstream we'll oppose them tooth and nail.""
And asked the night before by MSNBC's Rachel Maddow if he would consider trying to keep the seat vacant -- leaving the court with only eight justices -- Schumer said, ""Absolutely.""
""We are not going to make it easy for them to pick a Supreme Court justice,"" he said.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell responded immediately.
""The American people simply will not tolerate"" Democrats blocking a Supreme Court nominee, he told reporters.

It is unclear when President-elect Donald Trump will nominate someone to fill the vacant seat on the bench.
Ratcheting up the debate could impact the type of person Trump selects. He has a list of 21 potential choices unveiled last year meant to appeal to conservatives. He has options. He could look for alternatives not on the list, dig deep on the list to find someone who might garner less controversy, or go big by naming Judge William Pryor — a conservative favorite who also has attracted the most opposition from liberals.
Others on the list include Judge Diane Sykes of the 7th Court of Appeals, Judge Thomas Hardiman from the 3rd Circuit and Judge Steve Colloton from the 8th Circuit.
A Pryor nomination would be considered the least ""mainstream"" name on the list for liberals and could possibly force Republicans to push for a rules change and do away with the filibuster that is in place for the Supreme Court seat. Changing the rules is a delicate subject. Old Guard Republicans might push back. In 2013 when then Majority leader Harry Reid led the charge to get rid of the filibuster for lower court nominees, Sen. John McCain took to the floor.
""We are approaching a slippery slope that will destroy the very unique aspect of this institution called the US Senate,"" he said.
Of course it was Democrats who opened the door to a rules change when they got rid of the filibuster for the lower courts, something Schumer says he regrets.
""Wish it hadn't happened,"" Schumer told CNN's Dana Bash this week.
The argument could be made that Republicans would never have taken that first step. Secondly, there is a good chance that Trump will have more than one chance to name a Supreme Court Justice given that three justices are in their late 70's and early 80's. That seat could be the big fight as it would most likely move the court further to the conservative side. The argument: since that seat might prompt a rules change why not do it now?
Richard Arenberg, a former staff member for three Democratic senators and co-author ""Defending the Filibuster: The Soul of the Senate"" wrote this week in the New York Times that the Republicans shouldn't weaken the filibuster.
""The Senate has historically been the one place in our government where legislative minorities are protected, with rules to check overzealous majorities,"" Arenberg wrote. He said Republicans have other options such as using public opinion to force votes, requiring debate around the clock and focusing on endangered Democratic senators who must run for re-election in 2018 in states that Trump won.
The irony of the debate is not lost on anyone.
After Schumer suggested he might work to hold the seat open, conservative Ed Whelan tweeted ""seems like just yesterday that Left insisted that having only eight justices is a constitutional crisis.""
And when McConnell said that the American people would not allow the seat to remain open Jason Steed, an appellate lawyer, posted on twitter a fake picture of a head exploding referencing the fact that it was the Republicans just a few months ago who held the seat open.
The Heritage Foundation's John Malcolm has praised Trump's list of 21 and sees a big difference now that the election is over. After Justice Antonin Scalia's death, McConnell said the seat should not be filled so close to the election so that the American people could choose.
Malcolm told the Daily Signal that voters were faced with the concept of a liberal majority on the court.
""The voters, however, rejected this vision of where the court ought to go,"" Malcolm told the Daily Signal.
Elizabeth Wydra of the progressive Constitutional Accountability Center sees things differently.
""Given that most Americans support Roe v Wade, oppose flooding the political system with special interest cash, and believe in the values of equality and inclusion expressed in the Constitution, there is no reason to think they would support a Supreme Court nominee who would promote an extreme conservative agenda from the bench,"" she said.

109,snopes131,0,https://www.denverpost.com/2017/02/01/senate-readies-fight-supreme-court-neil-gorsuch/,Senate readies for fight over high-court nominee Neil Gorsuch,"WASHINGTON — Republicans in the U.S. Senate moved quickly Wednesday to advance the nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to the U.S. Supreme Court, but already there are signs the Colorado native could face a tough — though not impossible — path to the seat.

Hours after his selection, the newly minted nominee took meetings with Republicans across Capitol Hill, including U.S. Sen. Cory Gardner of Colorado, as GOP lawmakers talked of trying to confirm him by April.

Gardner’s Democratic counterpart, Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado, did not meet with Gorsuch on Wednesday but is expected to do so at a later date. He said little as tensions escalated over the confirmation of a judge from his home state.

Democratic leaders are demanding that Gorsuch’s nomination receive at least 60 votes — the threshold needed to overcome a filibuster in the 100-member chamber — to move forward.

“This is nothing new. It was a bar met by each of President Obama’s nominees,” noted Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.
That would mean Republicans, who control 52 seats, would need at least eight votes from Democrats in support of Gorsuch to add him to the high court.

A baseline of 60 votes long has been a tradition for Supreme Court nominees, but recent changes to Senate rules, along with the inauguration of President Donald Trump and Democratic anger at how Republicans treated then-President Barack Obama nominee Merrick Garland, have added new variables to the equation.

The root of the Gorsuch fight started in 2013 when Senate Democrats, in charge at the time, changed the filibuster rules so that a simple majority, rather than 60 votes, was needed to approve most presidential nominations.

The idea was to circumvent repeated Republican filibusters of Obama nominees, and the move infuriated Republicans — although it left alone the 60-vote threshold for Supreme Court nominees.

The question now facing Senate Republicans is whether they want to push the envelope further and require that all nominees, including Supreme Court candidates, need only a simple majority to pass.

On Capitol Hill, that route is nicknamed the “nuclear option,” and Trump on Wednesday said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell should use the strategy if Democrats decided to unite and block Gorsuch’s nomination.

“If we end up with that gridlock, I would say, ‘If you can, Mitch, go nuclear.’ Because that would be an absolute shame if a man of this quality was put up to that neglect,” Trump said.

In the hours after Gorsuch’s nomination, it was unclear whether there was support among Democrats for a full blockade of his candidacy. Many Democrats remain angry that Republicans last year stalled — and then stopped — Obama from appointing Garland to the Supreme Court.

“Especially after what happened to Merrick Garland — a very capable candidate who waited a year and never got one hearing — I would expect that the Democrats are going to look very, very closely at his judicial record and scrutinize it, and make sure he brings a level of impartiality and balance to the court,” Gov. John Hickenlooper said in an interview Wednesday.

Obama picked Garland in March, after the February death of Justice Antonin Scalia, but most Republicans refused to meet with Garland because it was an election year and, further, they did not hold hearings on his nomination.

“We expect Judge Gorsuch to receive a fuller and fairer process than Judge Garland did,” Bennet spokeswoman Laurie Cipriano said in a statement Wednesday.

Some Democrats are calling for a more hardline approach.

“This is a stolen seat being filled by an illegitimate and extreme nominee, and I will do everything in my power to stand up against this assault on the court,” said Sen. Jeff Merkley of Oregon, the Associated Press reported.

But there is a concern among Democrats on Capitol Hill that Gorsuch, given his credentials and reputation, is the wrong candidate to oppose and that they should keep their powder dry in case Trump gets another Supreme Court pick.

In 2006, Gorsuch was easily confirmed for his current spot on the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals by voice vote and was applauded by then-Sen. Ken Salazar, D-Colo.

“While I do not know Mr. Gorsuch well, I have had the chance to visit with him and learn about both his personal background and his professional experience,” Salazar said at the time. “During our meeting, I found him to be very intelligent, thoughtful and appreciative of the great honor it is to be nominated to the federal bench.”

Gardner was among the GOP senators who never met with Garland, and on Wednesday he was criticized by liberal activists for what they described as a double standard — as Gardner took his meeting with Gorsuch less than 24 hours after his selection.

“There is no excuse for the bad faith Gardner and his fellow Republicans showed after the passing of Justice Scalia, and Gardner deserves no praise for so quickly meeting with President Trump’s nominee,” said Ian Silverii, executive director of ProgressNow Colorado.

Asked about the difference, Gardner repeated a line Republicans used often last year — that the next president, not Obama, should make the pick.

However, Gardner would not say whether he would support changing Senate rules to confirm Gorsuch.

“I believe by the time we get to the confirmation hearings and the floor vote, there will not be the need to invoke the nuclear option,” he said. “I’m not even going to speculate.”

But Gardner added he would like to “see a judge who is confirmed with the support of the Senate and who has the ability to move forward without obstruction.”

Bio, facts, background and political views","Judge Neil Gorsuch, 49, is President Donald Trump's choice to fill the Supreme Court seat vacated a year ago by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia.

Gorsuch has the typical pedigree of a high court justice. He graduated from Columbia, Harvard and Oxford, clerked for two Supreme Court justices and did a stint at the Department of Justice.
He attended Harvard Law with former President Barack Obama. On Tuesday, Obama's former ethics czar, Norm Eisen, another classmate, tweeted: ""Hearing rumors Trump's likely Supreme Court pick is Neil Gorsuch, my (and President Obama's!) 1991 Harvard Law classmate.If so, a great guy!""

Since 2006, he has served on the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals, in Colorado. He is an outdoorsman who fishes, hunts and skis. On the court, conservatives hope he will become the intellectual heir to Scalia, long the outspoken leader of the conservative bloc.

“The real appeal of Gorsuch nomination is he’s likely to be the most effective conservative nominee in terms of winning over Anthony Kennedy and forging conservative decisions on the court,” said Jeffrey Rosen of the National Constitution Center. “He’s unusual for his memorable writing style, the depth of his reading and his willingness to rethink constitutional principles from the ground up. Like Justice Scalia, he sometimes reaches results that favor liberals when he thinks the history or text of the Constitution or the law require it, especially in areas like criminal law or the rights of religious minorities, but unlike Scalia he’s less willing to defer to regulations and might be more willing to second-guess Trump’s regulatory decision.”

Gorsuch is a favorite of legal conservatives because he has sharply questioned a three-decade old legal precedent that many on the right believe has given too much power to the regulatory state. The landmark 1984 Supreme Court ruling involving the Chevron oil company held that courts should defer to federal agencies’ reasonable interpretations of ambiguous federal laws.
In a ruling last August in an immigration case, Gorsuch questioned the wisdom of that doctrine, arguing that the meaning of the law is for judges to decide, not federal bureaucrats.

“Where in all this does a court interpret the law and say what it is?” Gorsuch asked in an extended digression on the subject. “When does a court independently decide what the statute means and whether it has or has not vested a legal right in a person? Where Chevron applies that job seems to have gone extinct.”

Other rulings give conservatives confidence that Gorsuch is a strong supporter of religious freedom rights. Last September, he joined a dissent arguing that requirements for contraception coverage in Obamacare ran roughshod over the rights of religious non-profits.

Gorsuch also wrote a 2000 law journal article and a 2006 book arguing strongly against assisted-suicide laws. The practice of allowing the terminally ill to end their lives is now legal in six states and is on the verge of being legalized in Washington, D.C.

While Gorsuch has a longer Washington resume than other judges considered by Trump, his family’s experience in the city was a searing one.

Gorsuch’s mother, Anne Burford Gorsuch, ran the Environmental Protection Agency at the outset of the Reagan administration. She was forced to resign in 1983, facing a criminal investigation and a House contempt of Congress citation over records related to alleged political favoritism in toxic-waste cleanups. She maintained her innocence and was never charged."
111,snopes133,0,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-finance-idUSKBN14V21I,Trump says won't divest from his business while president,"U.S. President-elect Donald Trump said on Wednesday he would maintain ownership of his global business empire but hand off control to his two oldest sons while president, an arrangement that watchdogs said would not prevent conflicts of interest in the White House.

Trump told a news conference he would resign from all positions overseeing his hotels, golf courses and hundreds of other businesses and move his assets into a trust to help ensure that he will not consciously take actions as president that would benefit him personally.

Trump, a Republican, is under pressure to distance himself from his businesses before he moves into the White House on Jan. 20. Unlike other U.S. government officials, the president is not required by law to steer clear of conflicts of interest.

“I could actually run my business and run government at the same time. I don’t like the way that looks, but I would be able to do that if I wanted to,” Trump said.

Ethics experts said the arrangement did not go far enough.

“Mr. Trump’s ill-advised course will precipitate scandal and corruption,” said Norman Eisen, a former White House ethics adviser under Democratic President Barack Obama.

Walter Shaub, director of the U.S. Office of Government Ethics, said on Wednesday in a speech at a Washington think tank that his office recommends Trump “divest his conflicting assets” to avoid conflicts.

Trump appears to be still involved with his business while preparing to take office, saying he had turned down a $2 billion development deal in Dubai he had been offered over the weekend.

The company that made the proposal, DAMAC, confirmed the discussions had taken place.

The Trump Organization will not enter into any new overseas deals while Trump is president and will only undertake domestic projects after a company ethics adviser has approved them, said Trump adviser Sheri Dillon. Details of how the ethics adviser would operate, as well as several other aspects of the arrangements, were not immediately clear.

Trump will only know of those deals if he hears about them through the news media, said Dillon, a lawyer at Morgan Lewis who focuses on tax and ethics.

Trump’s daughter, Ivanka, will have no further involvement in managing the organization or her own clothing brand. Ivanka Trump said on her Facebook page that she would take time off to settle her family into their new home in Washington. The president-elect has named her husband, Jared Kushner, to a senior advisory role in the White House.

Since Trump sold all his stocks last year, the Trump trust will hold only business assets and liquid assets such as cash, Dillon said.

A financial disclosure document he filed in May also showed loans from lenders such as Deutsche Bank DBKGn.DE and Ladder Capital LADR.K. Trump will not have to file a new disclosure form until 2018.

Many other ethics experts, including the U.S. Office of Government Ethics, have urged Trump to completely divest or set up a blind trust for his assets. In a blind trust, the owner does now know what the holdings are or how the assets are managed. Trump’s oldest sons, Eric and Donald Jr., will be running his business, so the arrangement does not meet that standard.

Dillon said that was not a realistic possibility for a family-owned company and any sudden divestment would hurt Trump financially. Unlike liquid assets like stocks and investment funds, much of Trump’s wealth comes from office towers and other real estate that cannot be sold easily, as well as licensing deals that could be difficult to unwind.

Stripped of the Trump name, many of these assets would lose much of their value, Dillon said.

“President-elect Trump should not be expected to destroy the company he built,” she said.

Dillon dismissed concerns that Trump could violate an anti-bribery provision in the U.S. Constitution, known as the Emoluments Clause. That applies to gifts, but not business transactions like renting a hotel room, she said.

Nevertheless, profits generated at Trump’s hotels by foreign governments will be donated to the U.S. Treasury, she said."

Titled ""Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,"" the executive order would start to make good on Trump's promise to tighten borders and halt certain refugees from entering the United States.
The text of the order -- in a break from drafts that had been circulating earlier this week -- drops a longtime Trump campaign pledge to establish safe zones in Syria to give Syrian nationals displaced by the ongoing civil war in the country a place to relocate.
The order bars all persons from certain ""terror-prone"" countries from entering the United States for 90 days and suspends the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days until it is reinstated ""only for nationals of countries for whom"" members of Trump's Cabinet deem can be properly vetted.
The countries impacted are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to a White House official.
""I hereby proclaim that the entry of nationals of Syria as refugees is detrimental to the interests of the United States and thus suspend any such entry,"" the order signed by Trump reads.

The total number of refugees admitted into the United States would also be capped during the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000, down more than half from the current level of 110,000.
""I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America,"" Trump said during the signing at the Pentagon after the swearing-in of Defense Secretary James Mattis. ""We don't want them here.""
He added, ""We want to ensure that we are not admitting into our country the very threats our soldiers are fighting overseas. We only want to admit those into our country who will support our country and love deeply our people.""

Trump's order will also cancel the Visa Interview Waiver Program, which once allowed repeat travelers to the United States to be able to forgo an in-person interview to renew their visa. Under the new order, these travelers will now have to have in-person interviews.
At the Pentagon, Trump met privately for about an hour with Mattis, Vice President Mike Pence, Security Adviser Mike Flynn and military officials and they discussed accelerating the defeat of ISIS, confronting global threats like North Korea, military readiness and the National Guard, a Defense official told CNN. The meeting took place in ""the tank,"" secure room where the Joint Chiefs meet.
Trump also signed a second executive action on Friday that would spur military spending and, as Trump said, ""begin the great rebuilding of the Armed Services of the United States.""
The President added that the executive action instructs Mattis to begin ""developing a plan for new planes, new ships, new resources and new tools for our men and women in uniform.""

Trump's order on refugees has been something the White House has been considering for days and the President was seen with the document on his Air Force One desk Thursday when he flew to Philadelphia.
House Speaker Paul Ryan praised Trump's orders on Friday.
""Our number one responsibility is to protect the homeland. We are a compassionate nation, and I support the refugee resettlement program, but it's time to re-evaluate and strengthen the visa-vetting process,"" Ryan said in a statement, adding, ""President Trump is right to make sure we are doing everything possible to know exactly who is entering our country."""
113,snopes135,0,https://apnews.com/article/f07d6b0d3ab643578703a40099d6b3f6,Mars investigating Skittles said to be intended for cattle,"A mysterious Skittles spill on a rural highway in Wisconsin is taking another twist, with Mars Inc. saying it doesn’t know why the discarded candy might have been headed to become cattle feed.

The case began when a Wisconsin sheriff posted on Facebook this week that “hundreds of thousands of Skittles” had been found spilled on a highway. Later, he updated the post to say the candy had fallen off a truck on its way to be cattle feed.

Only red Skittles had spilled out, and Dodge County Sheriff Dale Schmidt joked in the post that it would be difficult to “Taste the Rainbow” in its entirety. The incident gained attention after CNN wrote about it, citing a report from a local affiliate.

A variety of food byproducts are commonly used for animal feed, and Mars says it has procedures for discarding foods for that purpose. However, the company says the Skittles in question came from a factory that doesn’t sell unused products for feed.

“We don’t know how it ended up as it did and we are investigating,” Mars said.

Schmidt said one of his deputies came across the spill and sent him photos, which he posted on Facebook. He said the Skittles spilled from a box that started to disintegrate in the rain, and about half of them got out. The Skittles on the ground did not have the standard letter “S″ on them, he said.

The sheriff said he spoke with the farmer, but declined to immediately give the farmer’s name and did not respond when asked by email how the office connected the Skittles with the farmer.

Mars spokeswoman Denise Young said the Skittles were supposed to be destroyed because a power outage prevented the signature “S″ from being placed on the candies. She said Mars planned to contact the sheriff’s office and the farmer to find out more.

Linda Kurtz, a corporate environmental manager at Mars, said the company sells unused candies and ingredients to processors that incorporate them with other materials to make animal feed. She said Mars does not sell directly to farmers, and its procedures follow Food and Drug Administration regulations.

Kurtz said Mars determined the spilled Skittles came from its plant in Yorkville, Illinois, which does not sell products for animal feed. The other U.S. plant that makes Skittles, in Waco, Texas, sells to a local processor that melts them down into syrup.

Josh Cribbs, a cattle nutritionist and director of commercial development for the American Maine-Anjou Association, which promotes a particular cattle breed, said that the food byproducts that get used for cattle feed vary depending on what’s available in the region and particular time of year.

Cribbs said specific byproducts would be mixed with other ingredients to achieve a particular nutritional profile.

“You might think, ‘Oh my gosh, they might be eating a Skittle.’ In reality, that piece of candy is being broken down,” he said."

According to a newly released Gallup survey, Clinton has topped the list of America’s most admired woman for the 15th year in a row, and the 21st time ever.

In the poll, 12 percent of respondents said that Clinton was their top pick, with Michelle Obama in second place with 8 percent. German Chancellor Angela Merkel and television personality Oprah Winfrey tied for third with 3 percent of the votes each, and talk show host Ellen DeGeneres rounded out the top five with 2 percent of votes.The survey, conducted Dec. 7 through 11, has been run every year since 1946.

This year’s Most Admired Man was President Barack Obama, who garnered 22 percent of respondents votes. The year’s second most admired man is President-elect Donald Trump, with 15 percent of votes. Trailing in third is Pope Francis with 4 percent, followed by Sen. Bernie Sanders in fourth with 2 percent of votes, and Rev. Billy Graham rounds out the top five with 1 percent support.

Graham has been in the top 10 every year since 1955.

According to The Washington Post, Clinton has enjoyed a relatively high public approval rating for the majority of her 25 years on the national stage. However, her favorability rating dropped dramatically during her two attempts at the White House.

In 1998, as first lady during the Monica Lewinsky scandal, Clinton saw a favorable rating of 64 percent. However, at the end of her first run for president in 2008 (against then-Senator Barack Obama), her approval rating dropped to 44 percent (and her disapproval rating shot up from 28 percent in 1998 to 54 percent).

Then, in 2013, after spending time as the Secretary of State, Clinton reached her highest yet favorability rating of 67 percent (coupled with a 26 percent unfavorable rating). Her second attempt at the presidency once again plummeted her approval score. As of August, her favorability rating stood at 41 percent, while disapproval of Clinton rose to an all-time high of 56 percent."

James Peevey had a mission: to rid the city of ""all street obstructions.""

By street obstructions, Peevey didn't mean food carts, construction materials, roadblocks or potholes.

He meant beggars, such as the ones described in the Tribune as ""the one-legged individual who, with drooping eye and painfully lugubrious countenance, holds forth his hat for pennies"" or ""the fellows who yell 'ba-na-naas'"" and ""the woman with two sick children who was drawn through the carding-machine in a woolen mill, and who grinds 'Mollie Darling' incessantly on a hurdy-gurdy on a street corner.""

The alderman took issue with people displaying their disabilities on the street for alms or change — so he took action. In May of that year, Peevey pushed an ordinance through the City Council that banned anyone who was ""diseased, maimed, mutilated, or in any way deformed, so as to be an unsightly or disgusting object"" from being in the ""public view."" Beggars were fined $1 to $50 — a hefty sum in the 1880s — or shipped off to the Cook County Poorhouse.

Peevey wasn't completely heartless, though: He tried to carve out an exemption for a one-legged, one-armed soldier. But overall, his ordinance made the streets of Chicago unfriendly to those who were blind, deaf or disfigured.

Chicago was just one of several cities to pass an ""unsightly beggar"" ordinance — what came to be dubbed an ""ugly law."" The trend started in San Francisco in 1867, only two years after the end of the Civil War, and spread throughout cities in the West and Midwest from 1870 to 1880.

At the time, reformers viewed these laws as ways to better their communities. In his book ""The Welfare Debate,"" Illinois Wesleyan University professor Greg Shaw explains that the county poorhouse model (think: Charles Dickens' ""Oliver Twist"") that was supposed to keep the poor off the streets and in work turned out to be too expensive and too corrupt to maintain.

In fact, in 1872, the Cook County Poorhouse — which shared land with Dunning Asylum, the county's psychiatric hospital — was dysfunctional enough to warrant a complete overhaul. Within 20 years, the place was labeled a ""festering mass of moral corruption and official fraud"" — again.

It isn't a surprise that the poor sometimes preferred the streets.

But fear spurred civic leaders to keep the streets clear. They worried that disfigured beggars would scare women. They were wary of the tensions between the lower and upper classes. They felt a sense of religious obligation to help the poor. Community leaders settled on an idiomatic solution: out of sight, out of mind.

The ugliest part of these laws came from the underlying mistrust of those who were poor and disabled. Throughout the 19th century, there was an ongoing debate over who was worthy of charity. According to Shaw, most felt that widows and orphans — victims of circumstances — warranted help from the state and the wealthy, while able-bodied paupers ""were seen as chronically irresponsible and thus much less deserving of assistance.""

Those with disabilities, however, were caught between ""worthy"" and ""unworthy,"" and news stories gave people little reason to trust them. During an interview from 1880, the general superintendent of the Relief and Aid Society offered this advice to Tribune readers: ""The fact is that nine out of ten of these street-beggars are either impostors or thieves, who come to spy out the houses and give 'pointers' to burglars. Unless the applicant is known to be worthy of relief, nobody ought to give it.""

When the ugly law was in its heyday, the Tribune featured reports of blind beggars who, when brought to court, could suddenly see, and deaf beggars who could hear. Case in point, this snippet from a 1908 Tribune story about a deaf and blind beggar who had a hearing before a judge: ""As if by magic the man's hearing and eyesight were restored, and he took $80 from one of his pockets and counted out the amount of his fine.""

There were stories like the one of a blind organ grinder who, when arrested, was found with $710 on him and was said to treat his ""lady friends"" to car rides and cafe luncheons. Or the double-jointed 18-year-old who was put on probation for pretending to be disabled and begging for money. In 1902, the Tribune reported that the Chicago Police Department even declared war against a ""beggar fraternity"" that poured acid on their bodies so they'd cut a more pitiful figure.

Then came the first World War. Soldiers came home from battle, their bodies torn, limbs missing, minds addled. Attitudes toward people who were disabled started to change. In 1911, the CPD had issued its own edict ""prohibiting blind mendicants, legless unfortunates and other seekers of alms from exhibiting their misfortunes to the public view,"" but after World War I ended in 1918, no new ugly laws were passed. Instead, plans were made to help manage veterans' physical and mental care.

It was a slow process. The end of each subsequent war — World War II, the Korean War, the Vietnam War — and the work of activists on behalf of all people with disabilities shifted sentiments. Bans on jobs that were previously barred to disabled people — such as hotel clerk — were lifted. Mentions of Chicago police officers fining and arresting ""ugly"" beggars dropped off in the 1950s. The 1960s and 1970s saw laws drafted to protect the rights of the disabled and cities remade to be more accessible — and in 1990 the federal Americans with Disabilities Act was passed.

Somehow, Peevey's 1881 ordinance stayed on the books through most of that history. When the City Council finally voted to repeal it in 1974, a co-sponsor of the repeal, Ald. Paul T. Wigoda, said simply, ""It is cruel and insensitive. It is a throwback to the Dark Ages."""

Sgt. Guy Juneau with the Los Angeles Police Department’s Security Services told CBS2 the incident unfolded around midnight Saturday after a thrill-seeker climbed the mountain and threw two tarps over the “O’s” to make them appear like “E’s.” It was caught on city surveillance cameras.

The Perrot family visiting from Australia told CBS2 they noticed the sign from their hotel. At the time, it read “Hollywoed,” while city park rangers were switching it back.

“We looked out this morning, and the Hollywood, the double O, there was actually only one E left,” Lia Perrot said.

The sign was restored to “Hollywood” by 10:45 a.m. Sunday. It remains unclear who was involved in the incident, which was being investigated as a misdemeanor charge of trespassing, according to Los Angeles police.

Juneau said police planned to review security footage to identify those responsible. It remains unclear whether authorities plan to release the footage to the public. 
“Sounds pretty harmless for the most part,” tourist Mike Pham told CBS. “As long as nobody got hurt.”

An official for the Hollywood sign said the incident isn’t the first time the sign has been the target of a prank or act of vandalism.

Back on Jan. 1, 1976, a man named Danny Finegood altered the sign to read “Hollyweed,” the same day a marijuana law took effect, according to published reports. In November, California voters approved Proposition 64, which legalized the recreational use of marijuana.

It was one of several times Finegood altered the sign. In 1979, to mark Easter, he changed it to read “Holywood.” In the 1980s, during the Iran-Contra hearings, he changed it to “Ollywood” to mock Lt. Col. Oliver North.

Finegood passed away in 2007. His son, Matthew Finegood, told KCAL9 Sunday evening that he has fond memories of his father’s satirical messages. 

“I wasn’t alive for ‘Hollyweed’ or ‘Hollywood,’ but ‘Ollywood,’ I was like six. And I remember they were all in here. And they woke me up. And one of the guys worked for the local radio station, he was a cameraman, and he hooked us up with a helicopter ride at sunrise with the doors off. And we were out the door taking pictures at sunrise.”"

""We call upon China to return our UUV immediately, and to comply with all of its obligations under international law,"" Pentagon press secretary Peter Cook said in a statement, using the abbreviation for ""unmanned underwater vehicle.""

In the latest encounter in international waters in the South China Sea region, the USNS Bowditch was sailing about 100 miles off the Philippine port at Subic Bay when the incident occurred, according to the official.

Bowditch had stopped in the water to pick up two underwater drones. At that point a Chinese naval ship that had been shadowing the Bowditch put a small boat into the water. That small boat came up alongside and the Chinese crew took one of the drones.
The US got no answer from the Chinese on the radio when it said the drone was American property, the official said.
As they turned away, the Chinese did come up on the radio and indicated they were returning to their own operations.
US oceanographic research vessels are often followed in the water under the assumption they are spying. In this case, however, the drone was simply measuring ocean conditions, the official said.

Although it's unclear what the motivation was for the Chinese, the seizing of the drone comes on the heels of other provocative incidents that have happened since President-elect Donald Trump received a congratulatory call with Taiwan's President, a violation of the US's agreement with China's ""One China policy"". China publicly voiced their disapproval of that incident and contacted the White House at the time. "

Tom Cotton faced an angry crowd Wednesday at a town hall in his home state of Arkansas, as constituents demanded answers on everything from Republicans' plans to repeal Obamacare and build a border wall to funding for PBS.

The event took place at Springdale High School in northwest Arkansas, a pocket of relatively liberal voters in the red state. The venue was at capacity -- police said it held 2,000 people -- and the audience routinely screamed at the senator throughout the event.
Cotton dealt with the kind of face-to-face opposition Republican politicians across the country have seen since President Donald Trump was inaugurated.Chants of ""do your job"" and ""tax return"" permeated throughout the crowd, as did applause for Cotton at times.
Although the event was chaotic throughout, one of the most heated moments came when a woman named Kati McFarland asked Cotton about his support for repealing Obamacare. As Cotton attempted to move on from her question, the crowd erupted in support of McFarland.
The following questioner asked Cotton: ""What kind of insurance do you have?""
Another woman began her question by saying, ""I'm from Fayetteville, and I'm not a paid protester.""
Cotton paused the event at that comment to make clear he was not trying to accuse vocal critics at the event of being illegitimate or paid, as Trump and Utah Rep. Jason Chaffetz have done.
""I don't care if anybody here is paid or not. You're all Arkansans,"" Cotton said. ""Thank you for everyone coming out.""
As the event continued, dozens of people lined up at microphones to ask questions. Cotton ultimately extended the event by about 30 minutes while questions ranged from accountability for Trump, Obamacare, the refugee program, Trump's proposed border wall and many other policy areas.
""If we're so concerned about deficits, why are we paying for this wall?"" asked one man to raucous applause. A Fayetteville pastor asked about refugee resettlement. Quite a few people asked about Trump's tax returns and investigations into his connections with Russia. And a 7-year-old named Toby asked about proposed cuts to public television and alienating Mexicans by building a border wall.
Cotton kept his cool throughout, though he did not answer every question fully or to the approval of the crowd, which was largely -- and vocally -- opposed to major Republican initiatives. Cotton did, however, challenge one woman slightly who asked about gun control and background checks."

The father of Private Emmanuel Mensah, 28, told CNN that his son went in and out of the building twice while trying to bring neighbors to safety, but “on the third time he couldn’t find his way out.” Mensah’s uncle told the New York Times that his nephew brought four people out to safety, but died while trying to save a fifth.

Mensah immigrated to the Bronx from Ghana five years ago, the New York Times reports. The decorated soldier, who was planning to become a military policeman, was reportedly stationed in Virginia, but had returned to his apartment in the Bronx after graduating from bootcamp in December.

Though he lived in apartment 11, the Times reports that Mensah’s body was found in apartment 15. He apparently died of smoke inhalation.

On Saturday, Mayor Bill de Blasio thanked the soldier for his sacrifice on Twitter. “Private Emmanuel Mensah was a first-generation immigrant, a soldier and a New Yorker,” de Blasio wrote. “He gave his life rescuing his neighbors in the Bronx fire. His heroism exemplifies the best of our city. Rest in peace.”

Eleven other people, including several young children, perished in the fire on Thursday. The fire, which was started by a 3-year-old child playing with a stove, was the city’s deadliest in almost 30 years."

In this latest social media fad, teenagers are putting detergent pods in their mouths in what's being called the ""Tide Pod Challenge.""

Ingredients in the pods include ethanol, hydrogen peroxide and polymers – a highly-toxic mix of detergent meant to wipe out dirt and grime. Manufacturers have been concerned about toddlers mistakenly ingesting them, but now teens are popping them on purpose and posting videos of the results online, reports CBS News correspondent Anna Werner.

Nineteen-year-old Marc Pagan, who did it on a dare, told CBS News he knew better but did it anyway.

""A lot of people were just saying how stupid I was or how – why would I be willing to do that,"" he said. ""No one should be putting anything like that in their mouths, you know?""

Ann Marie Buerkle, acting chairman of the Consumer Product Safety Commission, says ingesting any of the liquid carries a deadly risk.

""This is what started out as a joke on the internet and now it's just gone too far,"" Buerkle said.

The pods are bright and colorful and to children they can look like candy. At least 10 deaths have been linked to ingesting these pods. Two were toddlers, eight were seniors with dementia.

Procter & Gamble, the maker of Tide products, told CBS News: ""They should not be played with... Even if meant as a joke. Safety is no laughing matter.""

More than 62,000 children under the age of six were exposed to laundry and dishwasher detergents, between 2013 and 2014.

The next year, Consumer Reports said it would no longer recommend detergent packets, citing ""the unique risks"" while urging the ""adoption of tougher safety measures.""

Buerkle says her group has worked with manufacturers to make the packets less attractive to children.

""Making that laundry packet opaque, less attractive, less colorful, reducing the toxicity and the strength of laundry detergent,"" Buerkle said.

The CPSC also found that elderly adults with dementia were confused by the product and have also ingested it. The danger to little kids is so high that researchers have recommended the parents of children under six years old not buy these at all and instead use regular detergent only.

Anyone concerned about the dangers of laundry pods can get more information from the American Association of Poison Control Centers. If you need immediate help, call 1-800-222-1222, or text ""poison"" to 797979 to save the number in your phone."

This is the third time in 37 years that the town of Ain Sefra in Algeria has seen snow cover the red sand dunes of the desert. 

Snow started falling in the early hours of Sunday morning and it quickly began settling on the sand.

While the town saw an inch or two, the sand dunes on its outskirts were covered in snow.

Photographer Karim Bouchetata said: 'We were really surprised when we woke up to see snow again. It stayed all day on Sunday and began melting at around 5pm.'

In 2016, the town known as 'The Gateway to the Desert' saw deep snow shortly after Christmas and it caused chaos, with passengers stranded on buses after the roads became slippery and icy. 

Come January 2017, the town saw snowfall yet again, and  children made snowmen and even sledged on the sand dunes.

Before that, snow was last seen in Ain Sefra on February 18, 1979, when the snow storm lasted just half an hour.

A spokesman for the Met Office said this morning: 'Cold air was pulled down south in to North Africa over the weekend as a result of high pressure over Europe. 

'The high pressure meant the cold weather extended further south than normal.'

Ain Sefra is located around 3,280ft above sea level and surrounded by the Atlas Mountains.

Despite its altitude, it is extremely rare to see snow in the town, and it is normally six to 12 degrees Celsius in January.

The Sahara Desert covers most of Northern Africa and it has gone through shifts in temperature and moisture over the past few hundred thousand years. "

124,snopes15,0,http://www.truthdig.com/report/item/noam_chomsky_has_never_seen_anything_like_this_20100419,Noam Chomsky Has 'Never Seen Anything Like This',"Noam Chomsky is Americas greatest intellectual. His massive body of work, which includes nearly 100 books, has for decades deflated and exposed the lies of the power elite and the myths they perpetrate. Chomsky has done this despite being blacklisted by the commercial media, turned into a pariah by the academy and, by his own admission, being a pedantic and at times slightly boring speaker. He combines moral autonomy with rigorous scholarship, a remarkable grasp of detail and a searing intellect. He curtly dismisses our two-party system as a mirage orchestrated by the corporate state, excoriates the liberal intelligentsia for being fops and courtiers and describes the drivel of the commercial media as a form of brainwashing. And as our nations most prescient critic of unregulated capitalism, globalization and the poison of empire, he enters his 81st year warning us that we have little time left to save our anemic democracy.

It is very similar to late Weimar Germany, Chomsky told me when I called him at his office in Cambridge, Mass. The parallels are striking. There was also tremendous disillusionment with the parliamentary system. The most striking fact about Weimar was not that the Nazis managed to destroy the Social Democrats and the Communists but that the traditional parties, the Conservative and Liberal parties, were hated and disappeared. It left a vacuum which the Nazis very cleverly and intelligently managed to take over.

The United States is extremely lucky that no honest, charismatic figure has arisen, Chomsky went on. Every charismatic figure is such an obvious crook that he destroys himself, like McCarthy or Nixon or the evangelist preachers. If somebody comes along who is charismatic and honest this country is in real trouble because of the frustration, disillusionment, the justified anger and the absence of any coherent response. What are people supposed to think if someone says I have got an answer, we have an enemy? There it was the Jews. Here it will be the illegal immigrants and the blacks. We will be told that white males are a persecuted minority. We will be told we have to defend ourselves and the honor of the nation. Military force will be exalted. People will be beaten up. This could become an overwhelming force. And if it happens it will be more dangerous than Germany. The United States is the world power. Germany was powerful but had more powerful antagonists. I dont think all this is very far away. If the polls are accurate it is not the Republicans but the right-wing Republicans, the crazed Republicans, who will sweep the next election.

I have never seen anything like this in my lifetime, Chomsky added. I am old enough to remember the 1930s. My whole family was unemployed. There were far more desperate conditions than today. But it was hopeful. People had hope. The CIO was organizing. No one wants to say it anymore but the Communist Party was the spearhead for labor and civil rights organizing. Even things like giving my unemployed seamstress aunt a week in the country. It was a life. There is nothing like that now. The mood of the country is frightening. The level of anger, frustration and hatred of institutions is not organized in a constructive way. It is going off into self-destructive fantasies.

I listen to talk radio, Chomsky said. I dont want to hear Rush Limbaugh. I want to hear the people calling in. They are like [suicide pilot] Joe Stack. What is happening to me? I have done all the right things. I am a God-fearing Christian. I work hard for my family. I have a gun. I believe in the values of the country and my life is collapsing.

Chomsky has, more than any other American intellectual, charted the downward spiral of the American political and economic system, in works such as On Power and Ideology: The Managua Lectures, Rethinking Camelot: JFK, the Vietnam War, and US Political Culture, A New Generation Draws the Line: Kosovo, East Timor and the Standards of the West, Understanding Power: The Indispensable Chomsky, Manufacturing Consent and Letters From Lexington: Reflections on Propaganda. He reminds us that genuine intellectual inquiry is always subversive. It challenges cultural and political assumptions. It critiques structures. It is relentlessly self-critical. It implodes the self-indulgent myths and stereotypes we use to elevate ourselves and ignore our complicity in acts of violence and oppression. And it makes the powerful, as well as their liberal apologists, deeply uncomfortable.

Chomsky reserves his fiercest venom for the liberal elite in the press, the universities and the political system who serve as a smoke screen for the cruelty of unchecked capitalism and imperial war. He exposes their moral and intellectual posturing as a fraud. And this is why Chomsky is hated, and perhaps feared, more among liberal elites than among the right wing he also excoriates. When Christopher Hitchens decided to become a windup doll for the Bush administration after the attacks of 9/11, one of the first things he did was write a vicious article attacking Chomsky. Hitchens, unlike most of those he served, knew which intellectual in America mattered. [Editors note: To see some of the articles in the 2001 exchanges between Hitchens and Chomsky, click here, here, here and here.]

I dont bother writing about Fox News, Chomsky said. It is too easy. What I talk about are the liberal intellectuals, the ones who portray themselves and perceive themselves as challenging power, as courageous, as standing up for truth and justice. They are basically the guardians of the faith. They set the limits. They tell us how far we can go. They say, Look how courageous I am. But do not go one millimeter beyond that. At least for the educated sectors, they are the most dangerous in supporting power.Chomsky, because he steps outside of every group and eschews all ideologies, has been crucial to American discourse for decades, from his work on the Vietnam War to his criticisms of the Obama administration. He stubbornly maintains his position as an iconoclast, one who distrusts power in any form.

Most intellectuals have a self-understanding of themselves as the conscience of humanity, said the Middle East scholar Norman Finkelstein. They revel in and admire someone like Vaclav Havel. Chomsky is contemptuous of Havel. Chomsky embraces the Julien Benda view of the world. There are two sets of principles. They are the principles of power and privilege and the principles of truth and justice. If you pursue truth and justice it will always mean a diminution of power and privilege. If you pursue power and privilege it will always be at the expense of truth and justice. Benda says that the credo of any true intellectual has to be, as Christ said, my kingdom is not of this world. Chomsky exposes the pretenses of those who claim to be the bearers of truth and justice. He shows that in fact these intellectuals are the bearers of power and privilege and all the evil that attends it.

Some of Chomskys books will consist of things like analyzing the misrepresentations of the Arias plan in Central America, and he will devote 200 pages to it, Finkelstein said. And two years later, who will have heard of Oscar Arias? It causes you to wonder would Chomsky have been wiser to write things on a grander scale, things with a more enduring quality so that you read them forty or sixty years later. This is what Russell did in books like Marriage and Morals. Can you even read any longer what Chomsky wrote on Vietnam and Central America? The answer has to often be no. This tells you something about him. He is not writing for ego. If he were writing for ego he would have written in a grand style that would have buttressed his legacy. He is writing because he wants to effect political change. He cares about the lives of people and there the details count. He is trying to refute the daily lies spewed out by the establishment media. He could have devoted his time to writing philosophical treatises that would have endured like Kant or Russell. But he invested in the tiny details which make a difference to win a political battle.

I try to encourage people to think for themselves, to question standard assumptions, Chomsky said when asked about his goals. Dont take assumptions for granted. Begin by taking a skeptical attitude toward anything that is conventional wisdom. Make it justify itself. It usually cant. Be willing to ask questions about what is taken for granted. Try to think things through for yourself. There is plenty of information. You have got to learn how to judge, evaluate and compare it with other things. You have to take some things on trust or you cant survive. But if there is something significant and important dont take it on trust. As soon as you read anything that is anonymous you should immediately distrust it. If you read in the newspapers that Iran is defying the international community, ask who is the international community? India is opposed to sanctions. China is opposed to sanctions. Brazil is opposed to sanctions. The Non-Aligned Movement is vigorously opposed to sanctions and has been for years. Who is the international community? It is Washington and anyone who happens to agree with it. You can figure that out, but you have to do work. It is the same on issue after issue.

Chomskys courage to speak on behalf of those, such as the Palestinians, whose suffering is often minimized or ignored in mass culture, holds up the possibility of the moral life. And, perhaps even more than his scholarship, his example of intellectual and moral independence sustains all who defy the cant of the crowd to speak the truth.

I cannot tell you how many people, myself included, and this is not hyperbole, whose lives were changed by him, said Finkelstein, who has been driven out of several university posts for his intellectual courage and independence. Were it not for Chomsky I would have long ago succumbed. I was beaten and battered in my professional life. It was only the knowledge that one of the greatest minds in human history has faith in me that compensates for this constant, relentless and vicious battering. There are many people who are considered nonentities, the so-called little people of this world, who suddenly get an e-mail from Noam Chomsky. It breathes new life into you. Chomsky has stirred many, many people to realize a level of their potential that would forever be lost."

She doesnt like to be touched by strangers. OK, no sweaty handshakes. Fair enough. But theres more. If you get nervous around Roseanne, try not to show it. Shes like a shark. If she smells fear, shell tear you apart, the makeup artist says.

As I wait for Barr to arrive, I contemplate the pop culture folklore that surrounds her: the alleged multiple personality disorder, the roller coaster relationship with Tom Arnoldwhich culminated in a bitter divorcethe theory (her own) that she may in fact be the reincarnation of Adolf Hitler, whom she has requested to be dressed as for her Heeb photo shoot. Nervous doesnt begin to describe my feelings about meeting this 54 Jewish grandmother.

With her hit sitcom off the air for more than a decade and the tabloid pages of her tumultuous life rotting in landfills, Barr currently spends her time working on a collection of essays on menopause, celebrity, pharmaceuticals and Jewish life in Mormon Utah (to be published by Simon Spotlight Entertainment) and disseminating her signature mix of insights and insults through her blog (Roseanneworld.com). She briefly kept an account with what she now calls that shit heap (Twitter) before deleting it, citing as her reason the idiocy of people and how ill-informed they all seem. Today, when she brusquely enters the photo studio, she seems none too happy about having been dragged from her self-imposed exile.

Hello, she barks in a general greeting to everyone and no one. I approach with the kind of caution usually reserved for wild animals and salute her with a Sieg Heil in honor of our shoot. She looks at me blankly and asks, Who are you? I do my best to explain, then abruptly break the second Roseanne commandment: Sorry, Im a bit nervous, I stammer. The second the words are out of my mouth I brace myself for the onslaught, but to my surprise I seem to have amused her and Barr softens into the loving, if somewhat irritated, matriarch who charmed a generation.

As the Domestic Goddess dons the famous moustache, transforming into Domestic Goddess Hitler, I notice that shes beginning to have fun. She nails the Fuehrers facial expressions with twisted glee, and as she takes the burnt gingerbread Jew Cookies out of the oven it occurs to me that Barr may be the last celebrity utterly incapable of giving a fucka quality theoretically easy to embody until its time to face the practical repercussions. Franklin Ajae, Paul Mooney, Mort Sahl and Dick Gregorys passings will tear my kishkas out, Barr laments. They gave everything they had to just tell the truth, and they couldnt make a decent living because of the choice they madenot selling out to Hollywood.

At 55 years old, truth is the key governing principal to Barr. Yes, she has plastic in her past, but she has since rejected the idea of staving off the aging process. In fact, clinging to youth now seems downright disgusting to her. Todays youth make me rejoice in being a germ-obsessed hermit, she confides. The thought of young people doing it is repulsive to me. However, this does not mean the lovable curmudgeon doesnt know how to party. I have the pleasure of drinking too much in my post-menopausal incarnation, she reveals. I like tequila, really expensive kinds straightup. I hate alcoholics and AA If you cant drink responsibly, dont drink at all. Dont go to meetings, whine about your character flaws and blame the fact that you are a sociopath on booze. Barr also supports legalizing marijuana and has plenty of theories on the subject. Kraft Foods invented pot. You have to realize that its a spiritual hunger, not a material hunger, that you are feeling, she says.

As we wrap up the shoot, Barr puts her Swastika armband, one of the gingerbread victims and a Polaroid of herself in the costume in a Ziploc bag, making it look like evidence from some bizarre crime scene. She plans on bringing it to her 13-year-old son when she picks him up from school. Maybe this will make my kid like me, she says with a sigh.

When the photographer suggests that we pose together for a quick snapshot, I put my arm around this slightly eccentric drinker and pot smoker who gets off on dressing like a Nazi, and it dawns on me: I adore her. No-touching protocol be damned, I lean in to plant a kiss on her cheek, and, to my surprise, she turns toward me and puckers her lips. The nerves Im feeling now are of a completely different variety.

Dubbed the Sweety with Nutella, the chocolate sandwich is served as part of Italys McCafe menu according to Brand Eating and comes packaged in the traditional burger box. While it by all appearances looks like a burger from the outside complete with a brown patty-like stripe around the exterior, the Nutella sandwich is meat-free.

The chocolate sandwich announcement quickly gained traction on social media, and has receive more than 60,000 shares. Some Nutella loving heathens in Italy have already made the journey to Mickey Ds for their dessert sandwich fix.

128,snopes19,0,https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/31/16830890/chinese-space-station-tiangong-1-debris-falling-to-earth,A Chinese space station is falling to Earth next year — but it’s the last thing to worry about,"Sometime in late March of next year, a Chinese space station named Tiangong-1 is going to fall back down to Earth — and some big pieces may survive the reentry. The module’s descent has caused a bit of concern about debris raining form the sky. But in reality, a falling space station is the last thing anyone should be worried about.

Satellites and spacecraft fall to Earth all the time. Vehicles in lower orbits get bombarded by small particles in the planet’s upper atmosphere, and that eventually drags them downward. But usually, these falling objects are small enough or shaped in such a way that they’ll burn up safely while re-entering the atmosphere.

The problem with Tiangong-1 is that it’s rather massive. Launched in 2011, Tiangong-1 — or “Heavenly Place” — served as China’s first ever crewed space station. The module weighs nearly 19,000 pounds and it’s pretty dense too. And it’s estimated that around 10 to 40 percent of a spacecraft will make it down the ground. For small satellites, that’s not much. For Tiangong-1, that’s between 2,000 and 8,000 pounds.

With space vehicles of this size or bigger, operators usually have a plan to safely get rid of them when they’ve reached the end of their mission. If a large vehicle has thrusters, it’s possible to use the spacecraft’s remaining fuel to fire those engines intentionally and dump it over the ocean. Or you can send up another spacecraft with an engine to dock with the decay vehicle and plunge it somewhere safe.

But that’s not what happened with Tiangong-1. The space station wasn’t really meant to last past 2013, but China decided to extend its lifespan for a couple of years. Then in 2016, the Chinese Space Agency announced it had lost contact and control of the space station. And its orbit has been slowly degrading ever since, meaning it will ultimately make an uncontrolled re-entry. Or in other words: “We don’t know where it’s coming down.”

The United States Space Surveillance Network and other nations’ space agencies have been tracking it, and all we really know is that it’s going to come down somewhere between 43 degrees North and 43 degrees South latitude. That may seem like a big area, but most of the Earth’s surface included in that region is covered in ocean. And most of the land that’s included is unpopulated.

So the odds of this thing coming down on your head are actually infinitesimal. There’s a little over a 1 in 10,000 chance it will hit any person or property at all. Plus, it may sound scary to hear 2,000 to 8,000 pounds of debris falling from the sky, but a lot of that gets broken up into pieces, some pretty small, that can spread across a range of many miles.

And this is definitely not the first time something this large, or even bigger, has made an uncontrolled reentry before. In 2011, the launch of a Russian spacecraft intended for Mars failed, leaving the vehicle stranded in lower Earth orbit. Called Phobos-Grunt, the spacecraft weighed nearly 30,000 pounds and it fell back to Earth in 2012, ultimately entering over the Pacific Ocean. NASA’s old space station Sky Lab also made an uncontrolled reentry -- and it weighed nearly 160,000 pounds when it fell to Earth.

Plus, in the more than 50 years we’ve been launching rockets, only one person is known to have been hit by space debris. Her name is Lottie Williams, and a tiny piece of a Delta rocket brushed her shoulder when she was out for a walk.

The good news is that Tiangong-1 will help experts better refine their space debris models. An international group of state agencies known as the IADC has picked this space station to track as it comes down, and following its descent will allow them to refine their prediction models. Unfortunately, they won’t be providing any warnings though. They’ll probably be able to pin down the time of reentry within plus or minus three hours, but exactly where and when this will happen is going to be uncertain for a while."
129,snopes2,0,http://www.spiked-online.com/newsite/article/the-wests-virtue-bombing-of-syria-is-a-disastrous-mistake/21303,The Wests virtue-bombing of Syria is a disastrous mistake,"We’ve had virtue-signalling  now we have virtue-bombing. A military strike designed not to defeat an enemy, or take territory, or achieve any kind of tangible political goal, but rather to make a showy statement about our presumed moral decency. A violent tweet. The military wing of gesture politics. The pursuit of PR by other means. And if virtue-signalling is annoying and often authoritarian, with its reduction of every debate to a showdown between the self-obsessed and its green-lighting of Twittermobs against those who dissent from that days virtuous orthodoxy, virtue-bombing is positively lethal. Its treatment of complex conflicts as matters of good and evil, as black-and-white tableaux in which there are evildoers and evil-sufferers and nothing in between, infantilises international affairs and paves the way for action driven more by the virtuous kneejerk than by clear, cool, realpolitik considerations.

The American, British and French assault on targets in Damascus at the weekend is an example of virtue-bombing. spiked is not a pacifist publication, but it is very clear to us that this is an act of war unanchored from geopolitical reason and ungoverned by the very basics of political judgement. This joint intervention will do nothing to help the people of Syria and in fact could make their terrible lot worse. As even some in the pro-bombing camp recognise, taking out a few alleged chemical-weapons facilities will not stem the bloodshed in a war in which the vast majority of people are killed by conventional means. And as they occasionally confess, weakening one alleged part of the Assad regimes military apparatus will do nothing to dent the Assad-Russia-Iran alliance to win back Syrian territory from the various opposition forces, some of whom are disturbingly backward movements given to beheading dissidents, obliterating womens liberty, and enforcing 7th-century diktats. In fact it could end up strengthening that alliance, through escalating the ante so that this alliance is now not only concerned with defending Assads authority over Syria, but also with defending its own global and domestic reputations against a new militaristic alliance of Western powers.

And strikingly, the virtue-bombing will also bring no benefit to its own authors. It is likely to be detrimental to their geopolitical and domestic interests. The first thing it will do is draw Britain and the US into a needless, further heated confrontation with Russia, risking paralysis, tension and even conflict between the West and the East of the kind we havent seen for many years. That some in the West will get to wrap themselves in the comfort blanket of the old Cold Wars binary global moralism  which seems seriously to be one of the aims of our political elites insatiable urge to bait the Russian bear in recent years  is likely to prove a short-lived high in a world that will become more fissured and tense as a consequence of the foreign-policy establishments reckless global behaviour. And the second thing it will do is boost the very species of Islamist extremism that has in recent years declared existential war upon the West and which in Europe has massacred almost 500 people in the past five years alone. Such groups, rife in the vortex that Syria has become, will benefit directly from the Western alliances actions.

This is perhaps the most shocking element of the strikes on Damascus: they make Western powers and their media cheerleaders objectively into the allies of some of the darkest, foulest movements at work in the world today. From ISIS to the Army of Islam to al-Nusra (now Jabhat Fateh al-Sham), the movements lined up against Assad are far from the rebels some Western media coverage would have us believe. They are ruthless religious extremists whose victory in Syria would make the Assad regime, with all its authoritarianism and anti-democracy, look like a pleasant memory in comparison. These groups have enforced terrible rule in places like Raqqa, Ghouta and East Aleppo and have committed barbarous crimes against civilians, including, it is widely suspected, with their own use of chemical weapons. These outfits will welcome the Western alliances actions and will see the Wests heaped pressure on Assad as a green light to their own violent ideological push against the regime. These air strikes are in essence a military wing of Islamist extremism, providing military cover and even moral rejuvenation to an anti-Assad movement that has virtually no positive qualities."
130,snopes20,0,http://www.eenews.net/stories/1060043378,CAMPAIGN 2016: Trump picks top skeptic to lead EPA transition,"Donald Trump has selected one of the best-known climate skeptics to lead his U.S. EPA transition team, according to two sources close to the campaign.
 

 Myron Ebell, director of the Center for Energy and Environment at the conservative Competitive Enterprise Institute, is spearheading Trump's transition plans for EPA, the sources said.
 

 The Trump team has also lined up leaders for its Energy Department and Interior Department teams. Republican energy lobbyist Mike McKenna is heading the DOE team; former Interior Department solicitor David Bernhardt is leading the effort for that agency, according to sources close to the campaign.
 

 Ebell is a well-known and polarizing figure in the energy and environment realm. His participation in the EPA transition signals that the Trump team is looking to drastically reshape the climate policies the agency has pursued under the Obama administration. Ebell's role is likely to infuriate environmentalists and Democrats but buoy critics of Obama's climate rules.
 

 Ebell, who was dubbed an ""elegant nerd"" and a ""policy wonk"" by Vanity Fair, is known for his prolific writings that question what he calls climate change ""alarmism."" He appears frequently in the media and before Congress. He's also chairman of the Cooler Heads Coalition, a group of nonprofits that ""question global warming alarmism and oppose energy-rationing policies.""
 

 Ebell appears to relish criticism from the left.
 

 In a biography submitted when he testified before Congress, he listed among his recognitions that he had been featured in a Greenpeace ""Field Guide to Climate Criminals,"" dubbed a ""misleader"" on global warming by Rolling Stone and was the subject of a motion to censure in the British House of Commons after Ebell criticized the United Kingdom's chief scientific adviser for his views on global warming.
 

 More recently, Ebell has called the Obama administration's Clean Power Plan for greenhouse gases illegal and said that Obama joining the Paris climate treaty ""is clearly an unconstitutional usurpation of the Senate's authority.""

 He told Vanity Fair in 2007, ""There has been a little bit of warming ... but it's been very modest and well within the range for natural variability, and whether it's caused by human beings or not, it's nothing to worry about.""
 

 Ebell's views appear to square with Trump's when it comes to EPA's agenda. Trump has called global warming ""bullshit"" and he has said he would ""cancel"" the Paris global warming accord and roll back President Obama's executive actions on climate change (ClimateWire, May 27).
 

 Leading the Trump DOE team: GOP hired gun McKenna.
 

 The president of MWR Strategies is well known in Republican energy circles. He was director of policy and external affairs for the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality under then-Gov. George Allen (R) and was an external relations specialist at the Energy Department during the George H.W. Bush administration.
 

 His lobbying clients in 2016 include Koch Companies Public Sector LLC, Southern Company Services, Dow Chemical Co. and Competitive Power Ventures Inc., according to public disclosures.
 

 And heading Interior's transition effort is Bernhardt, co-chairman of the Natural Resources Department at the law firm Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck.
 

 He served as Interior's solicitor during the George W. Bush administration after holding several other high-ranking jobs at the department.
 

 In addition to the EPA, Interior and DOE team leaders, GOP energy expert Mike Catanzaro is also working on energy policy for the Trump transition team (Greenwire, Sept. 14).
 

 During the Obama transition in 2008, a relatively small team was assembled ahead of the election in order to map out broad policy goals.
 

 Following the election, the operation expanded dramatically and teams were dispatched to work out of agencies to gather information from political staffers and career officials, write flurries of memos and compile thick binders of intelligence to hand over to the incoming leadership (Greenwire, Aug. 19, 2016).
 

 Should Trump win in November, Ebell, McKenna and Bernhardt will likely be leading similar efforts to reform their respective agencies.
 

 Ebell and McKenna directed questions about their roles to the Trump transition team. The Trump campaign and Bernhardt did not respond to requests for comment.

Eight-ton orca leaps 15ft into the air to finally capture dolphin he wanted for dinner after two-hour chase
 

 The dolphin was originally part of a small group swimming off the Mexican coast
 

 But the others managed to get away - leaving it at the mercy of a whole pod of whales
 

 With the setting sun just beginning to turn the sky pink, a killer whale leaps out of the ocean and soars into the air, spray cascading down in its wake.
 

 It is a magnificent image. Except the whales dive has a purpose the dolphin quivering 15ft below.
 

 

 

 These astonishing photographs record the final act of a chase that lasted two hours, and ended with the dolphin trapped in the jaws of the eight-ton orca.
 

 The dolphin was originally part of a small group swimming off the Mexican coast but the others managed to get away, leaving it at the mercy of a whole pod of whales.
 

 Dramatic: This killer whale was pictured attacking a bottlenose dolphin off the Mexican coast
 

 Astonishing: These photographs record the final act of a chase that lasted two hours
 

 Photographer Christopher Swann, who captured the extraordinary scene, said: The killer whales tore round at full speed for two hours.
 

 We never knew where to look because they erupted out of the water in one place, disappeared in a thrashing of foam and reappeared in a totally new location.
 

 On one occasion the killer whale burst out of the water directly in front of us, and about six or seven metres ahead.
 

 'He was about four metres in the air and heading right at us - I thought he was going to land on the boat but it turned mid-air and clattered into the sea beside us.
 

 Fortunate: Photographer Christopher Swann captured the extraordinary scene
 

 Hunting: The killer whales raced around after the dolphin at full speed for two hours
 

 The father-of-one, who has been whale watching for more than two decades, said the killer whale in the photograph appeared to do most of the chasing.
 

 Mr Swann added: The terror and fight for life of the dolphin was palpable. One felt one could feel the adrenalin in his veins and his pulsing heart as he raced for his life.
 

 [He went] back and forth but [was] always met by another whale blocking the way. Sometimes, three or four times, the whales would knock the dolphin out of the water - once with their tail.
 

 Gruesome: As darkness fell, the whales had the dolphin on the surface and it was all over
 

 

 

 

 

 Incredible when you consider that this was a large healthy dolphin. It is staggering how the whales treated it like a plaything."

 Teens trying to be funny are now putting themselves in danger by ingesting this dangerous substance, Ann Marie Buerkle, acting chairman of the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, told ABC News.
 

 The detergent packets are designed to dissolve when wet, so even putting them in one's mouth can be dangerous.
 

 Pat Sullivan/AP
 

 Already in 2018 there has been a steep spike in the number of cases of teens misusing laundry pods. The American Association of Poison Control Centers (AAPCC) said approximately 40 cases have been reported so far, ""of which around half were intentionally ingested.""
 

 Laundry-detergent packets commonly known as ""pods"" have been flagged before as a safety issue for young children. The small, colorful pods can be mistaken for candy by children.
 

 In 2017, the AAPCC said there were reports of more than 10,000 exposures to highly-concentrated packets of laundry detergent by children ages 5 and under.
 

 Children who consume pods can quickly become very sick and lose consciousness, according to Dr. Alfred Aleguas, managing director of the Florida Poison Information Center.
 

 Consuming the pods can also be lethal.
 

 ""Currently we are aware of about 10 deaths since laundry pods came out into the market many years ago,"" said Buerkle.
 

 Procter and Gamble, maker of Tide Pods, told ABC News in a statement that the pods should not be played with, whatever the circumstance is.
 

 Nothing is more important to us than the safety of people who use our products, the statement read. They should not be played with, whatever the circumstance is, even if meant as a joke.
 

 For any type of exposure, question, or if you need help, call the local poison center at 1-800-222-1222, or text Poison to 797979."
133,snopes23,0,http://www.nzg.ac.za/newsletter/issues/29/06.php,The intriguing case of Emma the lioness,"Male lions are well known for their long mane hair that covers the side of their head and neck, often extending onto their chests and ventral abdomen. Male lions start developing a mane when they reach puberty. This is mainly due to rising levels of the hormone testosterone. Male lions that are castrated, will lose their mane hair because the testes are the main site of testosterone production. Similar to castrated males, female lions do not normally produce sufficient testosterone to produce any significant mane hair. Emma grows a mane In April 2011, Emma, a 13-year-old lioness at the National Zoo starting growing a mane of similar length to that of a sub-adult male. Initially we suspected that she may have some abnormalities of her reproductive tract, so an abdominal ultrasound evaluation was performed at the Onderstepoort Veterinary Academic Hospital. However, all her reproductive organs appeared to be normal. Blood levels of various sex hormones were evaluated and as suspected, she had elevated levels of testosterone. We decided to remove her ovaries as these where most likely the cause of her elevated testosterone. This was done laparoscopically by Dr Marthinus Hartman at Onderstepoort in September 2011. Skin biopsy samples were sent to Stellenbosch University for chromosome analysis to see if Emma had some sort of sex chromosome abnormality, but the results showed that she had normal female XX chromosomes. The removed ovaries were evaluated by the NZG's own pathologist, Dr Emily Lane. Surprisingly, the ""ovaries"" that were removed, only contained cells normally seen in the testicles of males. This was obviously where the testosterone was being produced. Did Emma's ovaries change into testes? What makes this case remarkable, is that the zoo records show that Emma gave birth to four cubs in 2000. In order to give birth to cubs, she must have had normal ovaries at that time. Genetic tests done on Emma and her cubs, so far also seem to confirm that she is the mother of those lions. Further genetic tests are currently being done on samples from the only other female that was present in the zoo at the time to ensure that no mistake was made in identifying the mother of the cubs. If Emma proves to be the mother, then this case seems to indicate that Emma's ovaries changed into testes. This is something that is virtually unheard of in mammals. Other cases Other cases have been documented in the popular literature of lionesses that have developed mane hair. These reports have come from both zoo and free-ranging animals, but so far the abnormality has not been described in the scientific literature. Currently Dr Adrian Tordiffe and other researchers are investigating individual cases reported in the Kruger National Park and in the Okavango Delta in Botswana.

Only one additive floor amendment made it into the bill.

Senator Ted Cruz (R-Texas) offered an amendment to make 529 education savings accounts even more useful than today. 529 accounts up until now have been used exclusively for college tuition and expenses. The Cruz amendment expands the use of 529 dollars for two additional purposes--tuition for students in K-12 private and parochial schools, and costs related to homeschooling a child. Up to $10,000 per year per child can be distributed for these purposes.In a dramatic turn, the Cruz amendment was stuck at 50-50, requiring Vice President Mike Pence to hurry to the chamber and break the tie.

529 plans can be thought of as the rough equivalent of Roth IRAs for education--money goes in after tax, but then grows tax free. Distributions are tax exempt if used for qualified education expenses. If you participate in your home state's 529 plan (these accounts are mostly run by state agencies), you may be eligible for a state tax deduction.

If the Cruz amendment makes its way into the final bill (and there is nearly identical language in the House version, so there is a good shot of this), the game will have changed on school choice. Parents can start saving right away for private or parochial school, or for homeschooling expenses, in a 529 plan when a child is born. That money can grow tax-free for years to pay for things like Montessori school, Catholic high school, or home schooling networks. With a tax deductible component in most states, parents will get an immediate tax benefit, and then further tax relief in the form of tax-free growth. 
The best sign this is smart policy is that the Left is going completely apoplectic. They hate the idea that parents can free themselves from the big teachers' unions, and have vowed to kill not only the Cruz amendment, but 529s in general. Longtime readers might recall the Left made a run at that several years ago, and failed spectacularly.

Senator Ted Cruz deserves a lot of credit for taking this on. Thanks to him, it will become a lot easier for parents and their kids to have more options when it comes to education."

 FRANKFORT, KY - A Kentucky lawmaker has introduced a bill that would require men seeking treatment for erectile dysfunction to jump through several hoops beforehand.
 

 Rep. Mary Lou Marzian (D-Louisville) introduced House Bill 369.
 

 The bill would require that a man visit a doctor twice before the doctor can prescribe any drug for erectile dysfunction, be married and get a signed and dated letter of consent from his spouse. The bill also calls for the man to ""make a sworn statement with his hand on a bible that he will only use a prescription for a drug for erectile dysfunction when having sexual relations with his current spouse.""
 

 The bill's requirements would apply to medications like Viagra, Cialis, Levitra and Avanafil as well as other treatments and procedures for erectile dysfunction.

 Make hay while Donald Trumps sun shines perhaps this was the thinking behind the Lodha developers recent announcement of the re-opening of sales for the ultra-luxurious residences in Trump Tower, Worli. The announcement comes in the wake of Donald Trumps insurmountable lead as the Republican candidate for contesting the US Presidential poll. The project is a joint venture between Lodha and the Trump organisation.

 Posters installed by the developer along the project to attract prospective buyers read: Trump is back. With the smallest housing unit 3 BHK priced over R9 crore, bookings for the designer homes will start from June 4. Lodhas website quotes Trump saying, This project will be a jewel in the crown of Trump Projects. The website also states that every house owner shall enjoy access to a private jet and a 7-acre private park.
 

 Refuting the claims that the developer was trying to cash in on Trumps popularity in the US to turn around the lukewarm response the Worli project had received during the previous sale, a Lodha spokesperson said, Our current campaign for Trump Tower is in alignment with the groups business calendar for the current financial year, and not related to Donald Trumps nomination in any way. An iconic real estate brand such as Trump demands a unique approach in everything we do: right from planning to selling. Since the inception of our partnership with Trump in 2013, we have made conscious and careful choices in our go-to-market strategy, including offering limited inventory during a particular sale window. The spokesperson added that the last inventory was offered in 2014, where the group successfully sold over 50 per cent of the residences, and the rest will be available for sale in June.
 

 Despite limited sales window, the enthusiasm and trust in Trump brand is well reflected with premiums as high as 30 per cent generated over other projects in the vicinity, the spokesperson said."

139,snopes29,0,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-nuclear-summit-obama-medvedev-idUSBRE82P0JI20120326,Obama tells Russia's Medvedev more flexibility after election,"SEOUL - President Barack Obama was caught on camera on Monday assuring outgoing Russian President Dmitry Medvedev that he will have more flexibility to deal with contentious issues like missile defense after the U.S. presidential election.
 

 U.S. President Barack Obama shakes hands with Russian President Dmitry Medvedev in a bilateral meeting before they both attend the 2012 Nuclear Security Summit later today in Seoul, South Korea, March 26, 2012. REUTERS/Larry Downing
 

 Obama, during talks in Seoul, urged Moscow to give him space until after the November ballot, and Medvedev said he would relay the message to incoming Russian president Vladimir Putin.
 

 The unusually frank exchange came as Obama and Medvedev huddled together on the eve of a global nuclear security summit in the South Korean capital, unaware their words were being picked up by microphones as reporters were led into the room.
 

 U.S. plans for an anti-missile shield have bedeviled relations between Washington and Moscow despite Obamas reset in ties between the former Cold War foes. Obamas Republican opponents have accused him of being too open to concessions to Russia on the issue.
 

 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney seized on Obamas comment, calling it alarming and troubling.
 

 This is no time for our president to be pulling his punches with the American people, Romney said in a campaign speech in San Diego.
 

 As he was leaning toward Medvedev in Seoul, Obama was overheard asking for time - particularly with missile defense - until he is in a better position politically to resolve such issues.
 

 I understand your message about space, replied Medvedev, who will hand over the presidency to Putin in May.
 

 This is my last election ... After my election I have more flexibility, Obama said, expressing confidence that he would win a second term.
 

 I will transmit this information to Vladimir, said Medvedev, Putins protg and long considered number two in Moscows power structure.
 

 The exchange, parts of it inaudible, was monitored by a White House pool of television journalists as well as Russian reporters listening live from their press center.
 

 The United States and NATO have offered Russia a role in the project to create an anti-ballistic shield which includes participation by Romania, Poland, Turkey and Spain.
 

 But Moscow says it fears the system could weaken Russia by gaining the capability to shoot down the nuclear missiles it relies on as a deterrent.
 

 It wants a legally binding pledge from the United States that Russias nuclear forces would not be targeted by the system and joint control of how it is used.
 

 The White House, initially caught off-guard by questions about the leaders exchange, later released a statement recommitting to implementing missile defense which weve repeatedly said is not aimed at Russia but also acknowledging election-year obstacles on the issue.
 

 Since 2012 is an election year in both countries, with an election and leadership transition in Russia and an election in the United States, it is clearly not a year in which we are going to achieve a breakthrough, White House deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes said.
 

 Therefore, President Obama and President Medvedev agreed that it was best to instruct our technical experts to do the work of better understanding our respective positions, providing space for continued discussions on missile defense cooperation going forward, he said."
140,snopes3,0,http://www.cnn.com/2017/03/24/politics/house-health-care-vote/index.html,House Republicans pull health care bill,"""Washington  Seven years of Republican efforts to eradicate President Barack Obama's proudest domestic achievement ended Friday before a single vote was cast.

House Speaker Paul Ryan sensationally pulled his Obamacare repeal bill from the floor Friday afternoon, a day after President Donald Trump had threatened to walk away from health care reform if he didn't get a vote.

""We were very close,"" Trump said in the Oval Office after the bill was pulled. ""It was a very, very tight margin.""

The decision to delay the vote marks an acute embarrassment for the President, who had gambled big by presenting holdout House conservatives with a take-it-or-leave it ultimatum Thursday night and put his own credibility on the line.

But Trump repeatedly pointed the finger directly at Democrats, who all opposed the measure, rather than at his own party, which holds a significant majority in the House.

""We had no Democratic support,"" he said. ""I've been saying for the last year and a half that the best thing we could do, politically speaking, is let Obamacare explode. It's exploding right now.""

Trump reiterated the point in a tweet Saturday morning, saying, ""Obamacare will explode and we will all get together and piece together a great health care plan for THE PEOPLE. Do not worry!""

ObamaCare will explode and we will all get together and piece together a great healthcare plan for THE PEOPLE. Do not worry!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 25, 2017

The failure of the GOP plan also puts Ryan in a much weakened political position, after being defied by his own conference, which seems just as unsuited to governing in the Trump era as it was when it was effectively a protest coalition under Obama.

It became clear during a day of intense political intrigue that despite fierce arm-twisting by Trump, Ryan and other leaders that the votes simply were not there to pass the bill and the leadership and the White House were headed for a lopsided defeat.

They were unable to narrow the schism between Freedom Caucus conservatives, who believe the bill keeps too much of Obamacare intact, and moderates who worry they will pay an electoral price if millions of Americans lose health insurance.

The House meltdown on Obamacare repeal has perilous implications for the American health care system, with Republicans apparently unable to repeal the law but also unwilling to fix the deficiencies that the White House says will collapse the law.

""We came up short,"" Ryan told reporters. ""We are going to be living with Obamacare for the foreseeable future.""

Democrats were gleeful after the failure to even hold a vote.

""In my life, I have never seen an administration as incompetent as the one occupying the White House today,"" said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, the New York Democrat who spars often with Trump. ""Today we've learned they can't count votes and they can't close a deal. So much for the art of the deal.""

What happens for Trump and Ryan?

Politically, Friday's momentous events will race like wildfire through the Republican Party's conservative, establishment base, which has been told repeatedly by candidates that the first order of business with the GOP President in the White House would be to repeal of the Affordable Care Act.

Ryan told fellow Republicans they are ""moving on"" from health care, Reps. Andy Barr, R-Kentucky, and Bill Flores, R-Texas, told CNN. Trump said tax reform would be next.

Trump, the businessman who touted his ability to get things done and promised to transcend Washington politics, said he's learned from the experience

""This was an interesting period of time. We all learned a lot,"" he said in the Oval Office. ""We learned a lot about loyalty and we learned a lot about the vote getting process. And we learned about very arcane rules in both the Senate and the House.

""Certainly for me it was a very interesting experience, but for me, it'll be an experience that leads to an even better health care plan,"" he added.

The White House maintained after the scrapped vote that it is confident in Ryan.

""I like Speaker Ryan. He worked very hard,"" Trump said.

White House press secretary Sean Spicer said before the vote Trump has ""left everything on the field when it comes to this bill.""

But Republicans had few firm commitments from conservatives and watched a continued exodus of moderates. This was exactly what House leadership was worried would happen when they changed the bill, the source said.

But tax reform will be no simpler.

Trump acknowledged there are many different groups in the GOP, meaning things aren't as simple as having one party control both the White House, House and Senate.

""Lots of different groups. Lots of factions and there's been a long history of liking and disliking within the Republican Party long before I got here,"" he said.

Freedom Caucus held out

Most prominent of those factions, the Freedom Caucus, held out until the end, saying the bill didn't go enough to repeal Obamacare.

Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows, a North Carolina Republican, said he still wants to work to repeal Obamacare.

""I promised the people of North Carolina's 11th District that I would fight for a full repeal of the Affordable Care Act and a replacement with a market-driven approach that brings down costs and provides more choices for the American people,"" Meadows said in a statement.

Vice President Mike Pence met Friday afternoon with members of the Freedom Caucus at the Capitol Hill Club, a source familiar with the meeting said.

There are clear signs of frustration in the White House at the Freedom Caucus, which has won a series of concession but is still holding out against the bill.

""We've emboldened them,"" one White House aide said.

Rep. Leonard Lance, R-New Jersey, said that without a doubt, the decision to concede the repeal of essential health benefits to the Freedom Caucus definitely moved some of his colleagues to ""no.""

""I suspect some became a no because of that,"" Lance said. ""That certainly didn't help.""

What was in the bill

The GOP health care bill would eliminate many of the taxes and eradicate the individual mandate imposed by Obamacare, officially known as the Affordable Care Act. Instead of the Obamacare subsidies that are tied to income and premiums, the GOP plan provides Americans with refundable tax credits based mainly on age to purchase health insurance.

The bill also significantly curtails federal support for Medicaid and allows states to require able-bodied adults to work. After 2020, states that expanded Medicaid would no longer receive enhanced federal funding to cover low-income adults like they did under Obamacare, and states that haven't expanded would be immediately barred from doing so.

However, the GOP bill doesn't touch some of the most popular pieces of Obamacare, including letting children stay on their parents' insurance plans until the age of 26 and including protections for people with pre-existing conditions. But it would end the requirement that insurers offer comprehensive policies that cover maternity, drugs, mental health and substance abuse."""
141,snopes30,0,https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2016/02/11/stop-sending-around-this-photo-of-bernie-sanders/,Stop sending around this photo of Bernie Sanders,"Update: Ive heard conflicting testimonies from Danny Lyon, the photographer, and Randy Ross, Bruce Rappaports ex-wife.
 

 In trying to establish the civil rights bona fides of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), many of his supporters have taken to posting a black-and-white photo of the presidential candidate from 1962. Students can be seen sitting on the floor and standing in the back as the then-dark-haired activist addresses them.
 

 The compelling picture can be found in the senators biographical video on his campaign website. At the University of Chicago, Sanders says as the photo fades in and out, I got involved in the civil rights movement. We ended up engaging in a sit-in demonstration. Its on the campaigns Tumblr feed. As the Civil Rights Movement grew, Bernie led a sit-in to desegregate off-campus housing at the University of Chicago, reads the timeline under 1962. And Sanders used it in a stirring 2013 video to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the March on Washington. I remember the day very well and I remember the moment, the period well, he says as the photo passes by, because up at the University of Chicago, where I was then going to school, we were working with young people in the South.
 

 Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders recalls his personal history with activism in a campaign video. (Bernie 2016)
 

 But thats not Bernie Sanders in the photo. It is Bruce Rappaport.
 

 Classmates of the two men started raising concerns about the discrepancy last year. According to Time, four University of Chicago alumni told the magazine in November that they believed the man to be Rappaport, also a student activist, who died in 2006. At the time of the story, the photo was still captioned as Bernie Sanders in the University of Chicagos photo archive. But the pictures caption has since been changed.
 

 Alumni who knew them well said that was Bruce Rappaport [pictured], a University of Chicago official told me Wednesday. The caption was changed in January. This was just a case of honest misattribution, the official told me.
 

 When Time asked Sanders campaign strategist Tad Devine about the photo discrepancy last year, he said, This is the first weve heard of it. As we sit here right now I still think thats Bernie. But well take a look at it. Three months later, here is what Devine told me when I asked him about the discrepancy and whether the campaign planned to remove the photo from the Tumblr feed or the campaign video:
 

 When I originally used this photo back in May/June is was because the U of Chicago had identified the guy standing as Bernie. It certainly looked like him, and Bernie remembers being there as part of the protests. Then Time Magazine months later raised a question about whether that was him standing. To be honest we are not 100% sure if it is or not. As to why we would leave it in the video, I think it is an accurate representative scene of something that he was part of at the time, so I did not think I needed to redo the video we made months ago. There is no dispute he was there and part of these protests, just like there is no dispute that he was at the March on Washington, where we again used representative visual images.
 

 Sanderss supporters have been posting that picture everywhere to imply that he was in the trenches fighting for the rights of African Americans when rival Hillary Clinton was a Republican-supporting Goldwater Girl. Never mind she backed Democrats in the subsequent presidential elections. Or that her civil rights bona fides go back to 1972, when she investigated school discrimination in Dothan, Ala., for the Childrens Defense Fund.

 Sanderss involvement in the civil rights movement and his commitment to equal justice are not in question. Another old picture that appears in campaign literature and video of student-activist Sanders with the university president is not in question. That most definitely is him. Whats at issue is Sanderss misleading use of a photograph to burnish already solid credentials. For a candidate who garnered 92 percent of New Hampshire Democratic voters who said the most important trait for a candidate was that he or she be honest, the least his campaign could do is remove that photo from its Tumblr feed and stop physically placing him where he existed only in spirit.

142,snopes31,0,https://weather.com/storms/hurricane/news/hurricane-matthew-bahamas-florida-georgia-carolinas-forecast,Hurricane Matthew Recap: Destruction From the Caribbean to the United States,"Matthew formed from a tropical wave that pushed off the African coast in late September. That tropical wave was dubbed Invest 97L just southwest of the Cape Verde Islands on Sept. 25. It took a few days for that system to organize as it moved westward in the Atlantic. About three days later, however, the system gained sufficient organization to be named Tropical Storm Matthew near the Windward Islands.

Once Matthew reached the eastern Caribbean, it became a hurricane and rapidly intensified. Its peak intensity was late Sept. 30 into early Oct. 1 when it reached Category 5 strength with 160 mph winds.

Matthew then made landfall in Haiti and eastern Cuba on Oct. 4 as a Category 4.

From there, Matthew hammered the Bahamas Oct. 5-6 as a Category 3 and 4 hurricane.

The southeastern United States was then hit hard by Hurricane Matthew as it moved very close to the coasts of Florida, Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina. Matthew made one official U.S. landfall on Oct. 8 southeast of McClellanville, South Carolina, as a Category 1 hurricane with 75 mph winds.Matthew was declared post-tropical by the National Hurricane Center as it moved away from North Carolina on Oct. 9.
Matthew's U.S. Storm Reports

Storm Surge

On Oct. 7 in Florida, a peak surge of 9.88 feet above normal was measured at an NOS tide gauge at Fernandina Beach, Florida.

Storm surge flooding affected the St. Augustine area, including major flooding on Anastasia Island where water was reported to be 2.5 feet above ground level. To the south in nearby Flagler Beach, Florida, parts of A1A were washed out by the storm surge.

The NWS-Jacksonville conducted a storm survey and found a new inlet was carved between Marineland and Matanzas Inlet, between Palm Coast and St. Augustine Beach, Florida. 

The St. Johns River in northeast Florida reached its highest level on record at Shands Bridge, along with 3 to 4.3 feet of storm surge inundation reported at the Racy Point, Red Bay Point and I-295 bridge tide gauges. Early in the morning on Oct. 8, the St. Johns River was flowing backwards. 

Matthew's storm surge coupled with high tide lead to a record tide level at Ft. Pulaski, Georgia, early Oct. 8, and storm surge inundation roughly waist-deep was reported in parts of Charleston, South Carolina.

A storm surge of just under 8 feet was recorded at Ft. Pulaski, Georgia, between Savannah and Tybee Island, according to NOAA/National Ocean Service data. Fort Pulaski set a new record tide level of 12.57 ft MLLW (above normal low tide), which occurred two hours after high tide. This beats the old record going back to Hurricane David in 1979. 

Tide levels at the Charleston Harbor peaked at their third highest level on record with the morning high tide on Oct. 8, the highest levels, there, since Hurricane Hugo in 1989 and over a foot higher than the early October 2015 flood event. Water was entering homes on West Ashley in Charleston, according to the National Weather Service.

On the afternoon of Oct. 8, water levels were topping 5 feet above normal at Oyster Landing, near Georgetown, South Carolina, and at Myrtle Beach. In southern North Carolina, water levels on the Cape Fear River at Wilmington shattered a record from Hurricane Hazel in 1954.

The Springmaid Pier in Myrtle Beach was heavily damaged, a section of the Oak Island (North Carolina) pier was also also damaged by waves, and the Jacksonville Beach pier was also damaged.

On the morning of Oct. 9, major sound side storm surge flooding affected the Outer Banks of North Carolina. Interestingly, some of the strongest wind gusts in the Carolinas occurred after the center of Matthew passed by.

Rainfall Reports

Fayetteville, North Carolina, picked up over 8 inches of rain in 6 hours on the morning of Oct. 8 and totaled over 14 inches of rain from this event. As you would expect, major flooding materialized.

The NWS office in Wilmington, North Carolina, issued its first ever flash flood emergency early Oct. 8 for Horry County, including the Myrtle Beach Grand Strand and Conway, South Carolina, due to the combination of rainfall and storm surge flooding. Flash flood emergencies are only issued during rare, exceptionally dangerous events.
Matthew brought widespread flash flooding and record river flooding to eastern North Carolina where hourly rainfall estimates from radar were as high as 7 inches per hour. Buildings were flooded, roads washed out, and sections of Interstates 95 and 40 were flooded in the Tar Heel State.

 Sessions, speaking in Fort Wayne, Indiana, on immigration, pushed back against criticism he had received over the policy. On Wednesday, a cardinal in the Roman Catholic Church said that separating mothers from their babies was ""immoral.""
 

 Sessions said many of the recent criticisms were not ""fair or logical and some are contrary to law.""
 

 ""I would cite you to the Apostle Paul and his clear and wise command in Romans 13, to obey the laws of the government because God has ordained them for the purpose of order,"" he said. ""Orderly and lawful processes are good in themselves and protect the weak and lawful.""
 

 Last month, the attorney general announced a ""zero tolerance"" policy that any adult who enters the country illegally is criminally prosecuted. U.S. protocol prohibits detaining children with their parents because the children are not charged with a crime and the parents are.
 

 According to U.S. Customs and Border Protection, more than 650 children were separated from their parents at the U.S.-Mexico border during a two-week period in May.
 

 White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Thursday that she hadn't seen Sessions' comments but affirmed that the Bible did back up the administration's actions.
 

 ""I can say that it is very biblical to enforce the law. That is actually repeated a number of times throughout the Bible,"" she said. ""It's a moral policy to follow and enforce the law.""
 

 In an unusually tense series of exchanges in the White House briefing room, Sanders wrongly blamed Democrats for the policy separating children from parents and insisted the administration had made no changes in increasing the use. Until the policy was announced in April, such families were usually referred for civil deportation proceedings, not requiring separation.
 

 ""The separation of illegal alien families is the product of the same legal loopholes that Democrats refuse to close, and these laws are the same that have been on the books for over a decade, and the president is simply enforcing them,"" she said.
 

 ""We don't want this to be a problem,"" she said.
 

 Cardinal Daniel DiNardo, the archbishop of Galveston-Houston, told the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops on Wednesday that he was joining other religious leaders in opposing the government's border policy.
 

 ""Our government has the discretion in our laws to ensure that young children are not separated from their parents and exposed to irreparable harm and trauma,"" DiNardo said in a statement.

And the beautiful Ruth Negga was born in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, raised in London no, in Ireland I do believe, and shes here nominated for playing a girl in small-town Virginia.
 

 Ryan Gosling, like all of the nicest people, is Canadian, and Dev Patel was born in Kenya, raised in London, and is here playing an Indian raised in Tasmania. So Hollywood is crawling with outsiders and foreigners. And if we kick them all out youll have nothing to watch but football and mixed martial arts, which are not the arts.
 

 They gave me three seconds to say this, so: An actors only job is to enter the lives of people who are different from us, and let you feel what that feels like. And there were many, many, many powerful performances this year that did exactly that. Breathtaking, compassionate work.
 

 But there was one performance this year that stunned me. It sank its hooks in my heart. Not because it was good; there was nothing good about it. But it was effective and it did its job. It made its intended audience laugh, and show their teeth. It was that moment when the person asking to sit in the most respected seat in our country imitated a disabled reporter. Someone he outranked in privilege, power and the capacity to fight back. It kind of broke my heart when I saw it, and I still cant get it out of my head, because it wasnt in a movie. It was real life. And this instinct to humiliate, when its modeled by someone in the public platform, by someone powerful, it filters down into everybodys life, because it kinda gives permission for other people to do the same thing. Disrespect invites disrespect, violence incites violence. And when the powerful use their position to bully others we all lose. O.K., go on with it.
 

 O.K., this brings me to the press. We need the principled press to hold power to account, to call him on the carpet for every outrage. Thats why our founders enshrined the press and its freedoms in the Constitution. So I only ask the famously well-heeled Hollywood Foreign Press and all of us in our community to join me in supporting the Committee to Protect Journalists, because were gonna need them going forward, and theyll need us to safeguard the truth.
 

 One more thing: Once, when I was standing around on the set one day, whining about something you know we were gonna work through supper or the long hours or whatever, Tommy Lee Jones said to me, Isnt it such a privilege, Meryl, just to be an actor? Yeah, it is, and we have to remind each other of the privilege and the responsibility of the act of empathy. We should all be proud of the work Hollywood honors here tonight.
 

 As my friend, the dear departed Princess Leia, said to me once, take your broken heart, make it into art."

 Democratic Rep. Eric Descheenie, who is Navajo, said the protestors asked him if he was in the country illegally.
 

 Im indigenous to these lands, Descheenie told the Capitol Times. My ancestors fought and died on these lands. I just told them, Dont ask me that question. 
 

 Democratic Rep. Csar Chvez, who came to the U.S. from Mexico when he was a child, said he was asked by a female protestor who he was.
 

 Chvez told the Capitol Times that he told the woman he was an undocumented legislator, adding he made the comment for ""the fun of it.
 

 He said the woman then called him illegal.
 

 She said something like, 'Youre illegal. Once illegal, always illegal,' Chvez told the paper. I took no offense, no attention. It was just simply one of those things where youre going to have a stance and Im going to have a stance and were never going to agree on things.
 

 Its unclear how many of the supporters posed the questions. The Trump supporters have denied that they asked the lawmakers and others at the capitol if they were in the country illegally.
 

 State Democratic Senate Minority Leader Katie Hobbs wrote in a letter to the Arizona Senate president complaining about a lack of law enforcement on the scene, saying the supporters harassed staffers perceived not to be white.
 

 I can tell you that the Democratic staff who were yelled at by the protesters and called illegals definitely felt harassed and were not satisfied with the response, Hobbs wrote, according to the Capitol Times. They did not feel safe.
 

 The Trump supporters have denied the accusations.
 

 First, we were a group of several white, black and Latina Americans. To make assumptions that we were only calling out Hispanic representatives or non-white legislatures [sic] is a disgusting, blatant lie, one of the Trump supporters, Jennifer Caminiti-Harrison, told the Times in an email. We also had legal immigrants visiting the Capitol who stood in solidarity with us along with Republican lawmakers who thanked us for being there and stopped for a photo.
 

 Caminiti-Harrison and another supporter, Lesa Antone, said they were at capitol to protest Living United for Change in Arizona activists, and that the two women are against illegal immigration.
 

 The women told the Capitol Times they believed the activists from the social justice organization didnt have the right to lobby lawmakers about immigration."
147,snopes36,0,https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/former-tbw-ceo-sentenced-40-months-prison-fraud-scheme,Former TBW CEO Sentenced to 40 Months in Prison for Fraud Scheme,"WASHINGTON The former chief executive officer of Taylor, Bean & Whitaker (TBW) was sentenced today to 40 months in prison for his role in a more than $2.9 billion fraud scheme that contributed to the failure of TBW. At one time, TBW was one of the largest privately held mortgage lending companies in the United States.
 

 Paul Allen was sentenced today by U.S. District Judge Leonie M. Brinkema in the Eastern District of Virginia. The sentence was announced by Assistant Attorney General Lanny A. Breuer of the Criminal Division; U.S. Attorney Neil H. MacBride for the Eastern District of Virginia; Acting Special Inspector General Christy Romero for the Troubled Asset Relief Program (SIGTARP); Assistant Director in Charge James W. McJunkin of the FBIs Washington Field Office; Michael P. Stephens, Deputy Inspector General of the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD-OIG); Jon T. Rymer, Inspector General of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC-OIG); Steve A. Linick, Inspector General of the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA-OIG); and Victor S. O. Song, Chief of the Internal Revenue Service-Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI).
 

 Allen, 55, of Oakton, Va., pleaded guilty in April 2011 to one count of making false statements and one count of conspiring to commit bank and wire fraud. Co-conspirator Sean Ragland, a former senior financial analyst at TBW who reported to Allen, was also sentenced today by Judge Brinkema to three months in prison. Ragland, 37, of San Antonio, pleaded guilty in March 2011 to one count of conspiracy to commit bank and wire fraud. Allen and Ragland both admitted to conspiring with Lee Bentley Farkas, the former chairman of TBW, and others, to defraud financial institutions that had invested in Ocala Funding LLC, a facility wholly-owned by TBW.
 

 Farkas was convicted on April 19, 2011, on 14 counts of fraud for his role in masterminding the scheme, which was one of the largest bank frauds in the country. Farkas is scheduled to be sentenced on June 27, 2011. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has a civil action pending against Farkas in the Eastern District of Virginia.
 

 Co-conspirators Catherine Kissick, a former senior vice president of Colonial Bank and head of its Mortgage Warehouse Lending Division (MWLD); Teresa Kelly, a former operations supervisor in Colonial Banks MWLD; Raymond Bowman, the former president of TBW; and Desiree Brown, the former treasurer of TBW, have also pleaded guilty for their participation in the scheme. Earlier this month, Kissick was sentenced to eight years in prison, Brown was sentenced to six years in prison, Bowman was sentenced 30 months in prison and Kelly was sentenced to 3 months in prison.
 

 As TBWs chief executive officer, Mr. Allen served as an accomplice to Lee Farkas and his massive fraud scheme, said Assistant Attorney General Breuer. He concealed TBWs staggering deficits through false financial reports, which ultimately caused investors to lose more than $1.5 billion. Todays sentence sends a strong message that corporate fraud by senior executives will not be tolerated. At the same time, it demonstrates that substantial assistance in the governments investigation and prosecution of corporate fraud will be taken into account at sentencing.
 

 Paul Allen was a well-respected mortgage executive hired by Lee Farkas to be TBWs chief executive officer. Working from Oakton, Va., Mr. Allen led Ocala Funding, a TBW multi-billion dollar lending facility that was used to defraud investors of more than $1 billion, said U.S. Attorney MacBride. Mr. Allens sentence reflects his ultimate cooperation with this investigation, but also sends the message that unless executives expose and stop fraud when they first learn of it, they will be punished.
 

 According to court documents and information presented at trial, Allen and Ragland participated in the scheme from early 2005 through August 2009 by distributing materially false documents to investors in Ocala Funding that misrepresented the financial condition of the facility. The fraud scheme ultimately caused investors in Ocala Funding to lose more than $1.5 billion and Colonial Bank to lose $900 million.
 

 According to court documents and information presented at trial, TBW began running overdrafts in its master bank account at Colonial Bank because of TBWs inability to meet its operating expenses, which included payroll, servicing payments owed to third-party purchasers of loans and/or mortgage-backed securities and other obligations. In or about 2002, Farkas and other co-conspirators engaged in a series of fraudulent actions to cover up the overdrafts, first by sweeping overnight money from one TBW account with excess funds into another, and later through the fictitious sales of mortgage loans to Colonial Bank, a fraud scheme the conspirators dubbed Plan B. The conspirators accomplished Plan B by selling Colonial Bank mortgage loans that did not exist or that TBW had already committed or sold to other third-party investors. As Plan B evolved, co-conspirators at TBW also caused TBW to engage in sham sales of groups of mortgage loans, known as pools, that other entities already owned to Colonial Bank. As a result, false information was entered on Colonial Banks books and records, giving the appearance that the bank owned interests in legitimate pools of mortgage loans, when in fact the pools had no value and could not be securitized or sold. Neither Allen nor Ragland participated in the effort to cover up TBWs overdrafts or Plan B.
 

 Additionally, the co-conspirators at TBW caused TBW to misappropriate more than $1.5 billion in collateral from Ocala Funding. According to court documents, both Allen and Ragland played significant roles in the Ocala Funding misappropriation. The misappropriation caused Colonial Bank and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) to falsely believe that they each had an undivided ownership interest in thousands of the same loans worth hundreds of millions of dollars.
 

 According to court documents, the fraud scheme also included an effort by certain conspirators in the fall of 2008 to obtain $570 million in taxpayer funding through the Capital Purchase Program, a sub-program of the U.S. Treasury Departments TARP. In connection with the application, Colonial BancGroup submitted financial data and filings that included materially false information related to mortgage loan and securities assets held by Colonial Bank as a result of the fraudulent activity at TBW. Colonial BancGroup never received the TARP funding. According to court documents, Allen played a key role in causing materially false information to be submitted to and received by the government in connection with Colonial Banks TARP application. Ragland was not aware of this aspect of the fraud scheme.
 

 In August 2009, the Alabama State Banking Department, Colonial Banks regulator, seized the bank and appointed the FDIC as receiver. Colonial BancGroup also filed for bankruptcy in August 2009.
 

 Instead of upholding his position of power and trust as CEO of TBW, Paul Allen chose the path of fraud and deception in helping facilitate the long-running fraud carried out by TBW and Colonial Bank. Fortunately, the scheme came to a halt when an attempt was made to steal more than a half billion dollars from the TARP, said Acting Special Inspector General for the TARP Romero. Todays sentence appropriately recognizes the severity of Allens participation in the fraud along with his cooperation in the Governments investigation.
 

 As a result of this complex fraud scheme, these defendants cost investors and our financial markets billions of dollars, said Assistant Director in Charge McJunkin. Todays sentence shows that those who take advantage of investors and our banking and mortgage systems will be held accountable. The FBI will continue to work with our law enforcement partners and remain vigilant in investigating these illegal transactions.
 

 Todays sentencing marks the culmination of a large effort on the part of this agency and of the law enforcement and regulatory community, said Deputy Inspector General Stephens of HUD-OIG. More importantly, however, it shows our nation that is slowly recovering from a damaged housing market that we are committed to bringing to justice those whose pernicious behavior contributed to this condition.
 

  The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) Office of Inspector General is pleased to join our law enforcement colleagues in announcing this sentencing, said Inspector General Rymer of FDIC. We are particularly concerned in cases like this one where fraudulent activities involving employees of Colonial Bank in association with officials of Taylor, Bean and Whitaker contributed to the failure of Colonial Bank, resulting in a $3.8 billion loss to the Deposit Insurance Fund. We are committed to continuing our investigations of such criminal misconduct to help ensure the integrity of the financial services industry and maintain the safety and soundness of the nations financial institutions and the viability of the fund.
 

 Paul Allen used his extensive experience gained from employment with the government sponsored enterprises (GSEs) to assist Lee Farkas in his massive fraud scheme, said Inspector General Linick of FHFA-OIG. This sentence sends a strong message to individuals who would try to defraud Freddie Mac and American taxpayers, who have invested over $163 billion in the GSEs to date.
 

 The case is being prosecuted by Deputy Chief Patrick Stokes and Trial Attorney Robert Zink of the Criminal Divisions Fraud Section and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Charles Connolly and Paul Nathanson of the Eastern District of Virginia. This case was investigated by SIGTARP, FBIs Washington Field Office, FDIC-OIG, HUD-OIG, FHFA-OIG and the IRS-CI. The department recognizes the substantial assistance of the SEC. The department also recognizes the assistance of the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) of the Department of the Treasury.
 

 This prosecution was brought in coordination with President Barack Obamas Financial Fraud Enforcement Task Force. President Obama established the interagency Financial Fraud Enforcement Task Force to wage an aggressive, coordinated and proactive effort to investigate and prosecute financial crimes. The task force includes representatives from a broad range of federal agencies, regulatory authorities, inspectors general and state and local law enforcement who, working together, bring to bear a powerful array of criminal and civil enforcement resources. The task force is working to improve efforts across the federal executive branch, and with state and local partners, to investigate and prosecute significant financial crimes, ensure just and effective punishment for those who perpetrate financial crimes, combat discrimination in the lending and financial markets, and recover proceeds for victims of financial crimes.

 Defying Februarys climatic dictates, students lay in the newly fallen snow on the Frist Campus Centers North Front Lawn on Friday afternoon, feigning death, wearing coats covered with fake blood and sporting signs that read, What if you were killed for your coat?
 

 The protest, based on a campaign started by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) and organized by the Princeton Animal Welfare Society (PAWS), was designed to raise awareness of animals suffering as part of the fashion fur industry. The protest focused on Ugg boots, which are made from sheepskin and are popular among college-age women.
 

 In addition to Uggs, which are openly noted as derived from animals, fur marked as fake may not actually be, PAWS vice president Alex Barnard 09 explained, adding that clothing imported from China is often unregulated, and recent studies indicate that cat and dog fur may be mislabeled as faux fur.
 

 PAWS hopes to address these issues and change peoples perceptions of fashion through the protest.
 

 We want people to realize that fur, whether it is fake or real, is just ugly, and theres no reason to wear it at all, PAWS president Jenny Palmer 09 said.
 

 Princeton is an ideal place for the protest because of furs association with social status, Barnard said. There is a lot of wealth here, he explained. There are people who wear animal products here because they can afford them.
 

 While PAWS members see demonstrations such as last Fridays as pivotal to awakening activism on campus, some students see the protests as unnecessarily graphic.
 

 Aly Lopez-Aguiar 09 noted that while she agrees with PAWS mission to decrease the use of fur in fashion, the use of fake blood was excessive, she said. If somebody sees something that graphic, theyre going to be turned off of the issue itself, she explained.
 

 Palmer, however, defended the use of provocative images.
 

 Theres always a risk [of offending people], she said. Sometimes theres a lot of apathy; we need to have these shocking images to force people to recognize that the clothes they choose to wear have an impact on animals lives.
 

 Public protests reach a wider audience than the speakers, educational programs and other events that PAWS sponsors, Palmer explained. Protests like the one at Frist aim to alert the public to see the controversy over fur as a wider issue, she said.
 

 While such demonstrations are perfectly within PAWS right to free speech, the graphic nature of the protest might give a negative impression to prospective students and people trying to get a sense of the University, Haley Thompson 11 said.
 

 There are a lot of people [who saw the demonstration] who arent students here, and they might find it offensive, Thompson explained.
 

 For Thompson though, wearing Uggs remains a personal decision, much like being a vegetarian. You do the same thing when you sit down and eat a hamburger, Thompson noted. I dont feel like its all that different, and Im not a vegetarian.
 

 Seeing the demonstration did not change her mind, she added. Im still going to wear my Uggs.
 

 There should be limits, however, to personal choice, Palmer said. We appreciate the right of people to make their own choices up to the point where it affects others, she said.
 

 Because animals may be crammed into cruel slaughterhouses and gassed, decapitated or electrocuted, however, individuals must be especially conscious of the implications of their clothing decisions, Palmer said.
 

 People dont have the right to cause that kind of pain, even if they choose to, she explained.
 

 Barnard said he hopes, however, that the event caused people to reflect on their fashion choices. If just a few people are affected by it, its a success, he said. Just a few people can make a difference.
 

 Barnard also said that the event took over a month to plan and was delayed by concerns that students might misinterpret the bloody scene as a reference to Virginia Tech and similar incidents.
 

 Last year, PAWS and PETA joined forces in front of Frist to protest killing the killing of animals for food. The demonstration featured students representing packaged human meat in an effort to advocate vegetarianism."

 Nov. 11-14, 2002 -- Most Americans, and the rest of the world, would describe California by its popular tourist destinations and economic touchstones: Hollywood, Disneyland, the Golden Gate Bridge, Big Sur, Venice Beach, Silicon Valley.
 

 

 

 But there is another California, and it's home to the greatest garden in the world. The 400-mile-long Central Valley supplies fully one-quarter of the food America eats. It's a long, mostly flat and incredibly fertile pocket of land nestled between the coastal mountains and the Sierra Nevada range.
 

 

 

 There are no marquee destinations, only sober, business-first cities and vast stretches of farmland and cattle range. But the Central Valley is beginning to change rapidly.
 

 

 

 Families looking for lower-cost housing in California's inflated housing market are trading a three-hour commute to work for a little country space and serenity -- and once-fertile fields are being paved over to make way for subdivisions. Farmers are under increasing pressure to reduce their dependence on chemicals for higher crop yields. And amid all this change, there is a huge Latino population -- many of them illegal immigrants -- whose lack of economic mobility impedes their assimilation into the American melting pot.
 

 

 

 In a series of four reports, NPR's Richard Gonzales and John McChesney profile the promise and pitfalls waiting for the Central Valley as more and more people and businesses discover the ""other California:""
 

 

 

 Part One: The Central Valley's Identity Crisis
 

 California's Central Valley is growing fast and its biggest industry, agriculture, racked up $27 billion in revenues last year. Yet the Central Valley is often referred to as the ""other California"" or California's ""backyard,"" and the valley's inhabitants are acutely aware that they do not share in the glamour of Hollywood or Silicon Valley. As the population of the valley's cities grows and agriculture's power shrinks, the region's identity crisis has become more acute. Many in the agricultural community have a defensive posture toward the coastal cities -- even while the valley's new urban centers are pushing for a share in the cultural and economic success of the coast. NPR's Richard Gonzales reports.

 Part Two: The Problem with Pesticides
 

 California's Central Valley is the most dynamic agricultural region in the world, yet farmers there are under tremendous pressure from new valley residents relocated from the coast and environmentalists to clean up their act. For decades, farmers have been exempted from clean air and clean water standards that apply to other industries. But now, the state says it is going to bring them into compliance. It's the water standards that have the farmers most worried -- farmers spray on the valley floor a third of all the pesticides sold in the nation. If they have to cut back, farmers warn that prices of tomatoes, pistachios and the 300 other crops grown in the valley will be more expensive. NPR's John McChesney reports.

 Part Three: Central Valley, Going Organic?
 

 Some farmers in California's Central Valley say they have seen the writing on the wall, and have started efforts to grow without a huge dependence on chemicals. State officials are demanding that farms, exempted for decades, begin to comply with clean air and clean water standards. The birthplace of modern agribusiness, the Central Valley supplies a quarter of the nations' foodstuffs and sets trends for farming nationwide. So when big farms like Muir Glenn tomatoes ""go organic,"" it not only cuts down California water pollution, but it also provides a testbed for the viability of large-scale organic farming. But as NPR's John McChesney reports, going organic is not that easy.

 Part Four: Farm Labor and Illegal Immigration
 

 In 1949, historian and journalist Carey McWilliams wrote, ""The farm labor problem is the cancer which lies beneath the beauty, richness, and fertility"" of the Central Valley. More than 50 years later, McWilliams would probably come to the same conclusion. By the most conservative estimates, 50 percent of the valley's farm laborers are illegal immigrants -- other estimates run as high as 90 percent. Despite farm labor laws, workers are still subject to sub-minimum wages and dangerous working conditions. Whole towns are virtual labor camps aptly described as ""California's Appalachia."" The region is home to a multi-generational underclass of low-skilled, poorly educated workers and their families. But unlike immigrants of the past, these workers show no sign of being absorbed into an economic track that will improve their lives.

So imagine the surprise of amateur photographer Karim Bouchetata when he awoke to see his picturesque town and the surrounding sand dunes covered in a blanket of snow. Thankfully for us, he grabbed his camera.
 

 Ain Sefra is located in northwest Algeria about 220 miles (350 km) south of the Mediterranean sea, and right on the northern hub of the Sahara desert. Bouchetata said he was stunned to see snow falling in the desert, telling Gizmodo its an exceptionally rare occurrence. This kind of thing happens about once every 10 years or so.
 

 The last major snowfallif it can be called thatto hit Ain Sefra was in February 1979 when it snowed for a whopping 30 minutes. Subsequent dustings of snow also appeared in 2005 and 2012. The desert town is located about 1,000 meters above sea level, and is surrounded by the Atlas Mountains.
 

 Bouchetata said the snow looked amazing at it settled onto the bright orange sand dunes, creating a perfect opportunity to take some photos. The snow only lasted for one day, and has since melted away.

151,snopes4,0,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/27/us/ben-carson-hud-furniture.html,"Ben Carsons HUD Spends $31,000 on Dining Set for His Office","WASHINGTON — Department of Housing and Urban Development officials spent $31,000 on a new dining room set for Secretary Ben Carson’s office in late 2017 — just as the White House circulated its plans to slash HUD’s programs for the homeless, elderly and poor, according to federal procurement records.
The purchase of the custom hardwood table, chairs and hutch came a month after a top agency staff member filed a whistle-blower complaint charging Mr. Carson’s wife, Candy Carson, with pressuring department officials to find money for the expensive redecoration of his offices, even if it meant circumventing the law.
Mr. Carson is also facing questions on another front. Under pressure earlier this month, he requested that HUD’s inspector general investigate his son’s involvement in a department-sponsored listening tour of Baltimore last summer. Department lawyers had warned Mr. Carson that including Ben Carson Jr., an entrepreneur who does business with the federal government, could create a conflict of interest.
Mr. Carson “didn’t know the table had been purchased,” but does not believe the cost was too steep and does not intend to return it, said Raffi Williams, a HUD spokesman.
Department officials did not request approval from the House or Senate Appropriations Committees for the expenditure of $31,561, even though federal law requires congressional approval “to furnish or redecorate the office of a department head” if the cost exceeds $5,000.
Mr. Williams said department officials did not request congressional approval because the dining set served a “building-wide need.” The table is inside the secretary’s 10th-floor office suite.
The decision was made by a “career staffer” who selected the company, Sebree and Associates, which is based in Mr. Carson’s longtime hometown, Baltimore, from a list of preapproved federal contractors, Mr. Williams said.
Neither Mr. Carson nor his wife — who expressed a strong interest in sprucing up the drab, wood-paneled, 1960s-era secretary’s suite, according to several current and former department staff members — requested that the 50-year-old table be replaced, Mr. Williams said.
But he had remarked how the previous table was covered in scratches, scuff marks and cracks. Mr. Williams emailed several pictures of the old table, which looks polished and not visibly scarred, during events held by Mr. Carson’s predecessor, Julián Castro.
The new table, listed as “household furniture” in federal procurement documents, has not yet arrived.
About a month before it was ordered, Helen G. Foster, a former top HUD official, filed a complaint with the Office of Special Counsel, a federal whistle-blower agency, claiming that she had been demoted and transferred after resisting Mrs. Carson’s attempts to get around the $5,000 redecoration law.
The pressure began in January 2017, before Mr. Carson was even confirmed, when HUD’s interim secretary, Craig Clemmensen, told Mrs. Foster to help secure redecorating funds for Mrs. Carson, a frequent visitor to the department’s Washington headquarters who serves as an informal adviser to her husband, the complaint said.
Mr. Clemmensen, acting on Mrs. Carson’s behalf, told Mrs. Foster to “find money” to purchase better furniture for the office — and he quipped that “$5,000 will not even buy a decent chair,” according to the complaint, which was reported by The Guardian newspaper.
Mrs. Foster refused to comply, and said she then sent HUD officials the text of the law requiring congressional approval for the purchases. After she was removed from her position as the department’s chief administrative officer, she was made head of the agency’s unit overseeing Freedom of Information Act requests, which she viewed as an act of retribution.
She “has suffered much humiliation and a loss of reputation, and harm to career advancement, as a result of this retaliatory reassignment,” according to a letter written by her lawyer, Joseph Kaplan, to the head of the special counsel investigations unit on Nov. 3.
Mr. Williams said Mrs. Foster was reassigned as part of a routine agency reshuffle, and denied that Mrs. Carson pressured her to help redecorate the office.
“Secretary Carson, to the best of our knowledge, is the only secretary to go to the subbasement at his agency to select the furniture for his office,” Mr. Williams said.

 Scaramucci has been targeting the leaks that are coming out of the White House and believes his financial disclosure report, which is public information, has been the subject of one of those leaks. He cited Paterno, whose reputation was tarnished by the lengthy child sex-abuse scandal involving his former assistant coach, on honor and dignity and respect. Paterno, the schools legendary coach, died just months after being fired days after the scandal became public in November 2011.
 

 Why dont you honor the job? Scaramucci told New Day anchor Chris Cuomo. Remember Joe Paterno? What would he say? Act like youve been there before. Act with honor and dignity and respect and hold the confidence of the presidency and his office.
 

 Scaramucci had tweeted and then deleted a call for the FBI to investigate the leak, calling it a felony and tagging White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus in the tweet. The CNN call-in was one that Aaron Blake of The Fix writes is the kind of reality-TV drama that the president seems to thrive upon: Having two of his closest advisers battle it out for loyalty, including one of them doing it on Trumps obsession: cable news.
 

 Of course, this isnt the first time Scaramucci has mentioned Paterno and it appears that he pays almost as much attention to sports as Trump. Scaramucci is a minority owner of the New York Mets and was part of a group that purchased the jersey Mike Piazza wore in the first baseball game after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. He may not be as consumed by football as his boss, who has railed about the NFL becoming soft just like our country has become soft, but he pays attention. On Jan. 22, 2012, the day Paterno died, Scaramucci tweeted about him, saying he had met the coach twice. He was an honorable man. He made the mistake not understanding evil comes in the form of many faces.

153,snopes41,0,https://variety.com/2017/tv/news/bill-maher-n-word-backlash-reaction-1202453193/,"Pressure Builds on HBO, Bill Maher After Host Uses Racial Slur on Real Time Variety","Bill Maher apologized and HBO scolded him publicly. But will that be enough to quiet the storm over Mahers use of a racial slur during Fridays edition of Real Time with Bill Maher?

 Public outrage swelled following Fridays 10 p.m. live airing of Real Time with Bill Maher. HBO issued a statement Saturday calling the hosts use of the phrase Im a house n during an interview with Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse completely inexcusable and tasteless. HBO said the remark would be edited out of subsequent airings of the episode. Maher made the comment in jest after Sasse invited Maher to spend a day working in the fields of Nebraskas farms.

 Maher acknowledged that the N-word was offensive and said he regretted using it. Friday nights are always my worst night of sleep because Im up reflecting on the things I should or shouldnt have said on my live show. Last night was a particularly long night as I regret the word I used in the banter of a live moment, he said in a statement issued Saturday.

 By multiple accounts, HBO has no plans to take any action against Maher, who has been a mainstay at the network since 2003. A source noted that Maher has rarely offered any kind of mea culpa for provocative comments. Most recently, he stood firm in the face of harsh criticism for his decision to have the controversial blogger Milo Yiannopoulos, known for his racially charged online postings, as a guest on his show. The formal apology for using the N-word indicates that he recognizes that a line was crossed, something that was important to HBO.

 But the fury voiced on social media after Fridays airing stirred up examples of past statements from Maher about Muslims and the LGBTQ community that were widely deemed offensive. ThinkProgress, the editorial arm of the liberal Center for American Progress Action Fund, posted an article declaring Bill Maher has been a public racist for a long time with links to past clips from Real Time.

 The anger is an echo of the groundswell that led to the ouster in April of Bill OReilly, after the New York Times published an expose on sexual harassment allegations leveled at the Fox News host. It also has a parallel in Mahers past. Mahers ABC late-night show Politically Incorrect was axed after five years in June 2002 following Mahers observation that the U.S.s post-9/11 bombing campaigns against terrorist targets were cowardly acts. The comment sparked advertiser defections from the show a pressure point that cant be used in the commercial-free environment of HBO.

 But at a moment of great political and cultural strife in the country, inflammatory statements and actions have been the undoing of numerous public figures. Just this past week, Kathy Griffin was forced to apologize amid a tidal wave of criticism from both the right and the left when she posed for a photo with a prop depicting President Trumps bloodied, severed head. Despite her apology, that stunt quickly cost Griffin her gig co-hosting CNNs New Years Eve coverage with Anderson Cooper.

 For Maher, another damaging video clip making the rounds on Saturday is an interview with comedian Wayne Brady from HuffPost Live in 2012, after Brady and Maher tangled over the latters assertion that Brady was a non-threatening black man. Brady said the comment indicates that Maher has a stereotypical view of black men as menacing.

 When I talk to you again, Ill give you that black dude and I will beat your ass in public, Brady said of Maher in 2012.

 Maher and Real Time have long been highly regarded in industry circles for the hosts willingness to confront thorny issues. The show earned consecutive Emmy noms for best talk-variety show from 2005 through 2014, and was nommed again in 2016.

 Reaction from viewers and industry insiders via social media to Mahers comment was, not surprisingly, fast and furious, and overwhelmingly negative. But Maher does have prominent supporters, such as author and Georgetown University professor Michael Eric Dyson.

 Dyson condemned Mahers use of the N-word but defended his record of offering a platform to an array of African-American perspectives on politics and culture. Given the Bill Maher I know, he will use this opportunity to strengthen his role as an ally to black people, Dyson wrote.

 Spike Lee, meanwhile, had mixed feelings about the comedian.

 Oh, him using the n-word? I think its problematic. Ill leave it at that, he told Variety at a Brooklyn event on Saturday. I like Bill Maher, but I dont know if he should have used the n-word."
154,snopes42,0,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/polar-bear-starving-arctic-sea-ice-melt-climate-change-spd,Heart-Wrenching Video Shows Starving Polar Bear on Iceless Land,"When photographer Paul Nicklen and filmmakers from conservation group Sea Legacy arrived on Somerset Island—near the larger Baffin Island—in the Canadian Arctic in late summer, they came across a heartbreaking sight: a starving polar bear on its deathbed.

Nicklen is no stranger to bears. From the time he was a child growing up in Canada's far north the biologist turned wildlife photographer has seen over 3,000 bears in the wild. But the emaciated polar bear, featured in videos Nicklen published to social media on December 5, was one of the most gut-wrenching sights he's ever seen.

""We stood there crying—filming with tears rolling down our cheeks,"" he said.

Video shows the polar bear clinging to life, its white hair limply covering its thin, bony frame. One of the bear's back legs drags behind it as it walks, likely due to muscle atrophy. Looking for food, the polar bear slowly rummages through a nearby trashcan used seasonally by Inuit fishers. It finds nothing and resignedly collapses back down onto the ground.

In the days since Nicklen posted the footage, he's been asked why he didn’t intervene.

""Of course, that crossed my mind,"" said Nicklen. ""But it's not like I walk around with a tranquilizer gun or 400 pounds of seal meat.""

And even if he did, said Nicklen, he only would have been prolonging the bear's misery. Plus, feeding wild polar bears is illegal in Canada.

The wildlife photographer says he filmed the bear's slow, beleaguered death because he didn't want it to die in vain.

""When scientists say bears are going extinct, I want people to realize what it looks like. Bears are going to starve to death,"" said Nicklen. ""This is what a starving bear looks like.""

The Climate Change Link?
By telling the story of one polar bear, Nicklen hopes to convey a larger message about how a warming climate has deadly consequences.

Polar bears have long been unwitting mascots for the effects of climate change. As animals that live only in Arctic regions, they're often the first to feel the impacts of warming temperatures and rising seas.

The large, half-ton bears find concentrations of seals on sea ice. During summer months, it's not uncommon for polar bears to go months without eating while they wait for Arctic ice to solidify.

In 2002, a World Wildlife Fund report predicted that climate change could eventually lead to polar bear endangerment or extinction. Even then, the report found that polar bears were moving from ice to land earlier and staying on land longer, unhealthily extending the bears' fasting season. By the end of summer, most bears studied by the World Wildlife Fund showed signs of starvation.

Fifteen years later, polar bears' icy hunting grounds are in even worse shape. The National Snow and Ice Data Center, which tracks sea ice cover annually, has regularly noted record lows in sea ice coverage—a decline that is expected to only get worse. (Read more about drastic predictions for dwindling sea ice.)

A study recently published in the journal Biosciences looked at how climate science is often falsely discredited. The study found climate deniers are able to downplay the threat of climate change by discrediting the threat facing polar bears. 
However, a study published last year by the European Geosciences Union and this year by the U.S. Geological Survey confirms melting sea ice continues to be an existential threat to polar bears."

 Sam Kanizay, 16, was soaking his legs in the water at Dendy Street Beach in Brighton, Melbourne, on Saturday evening when he said he felt his legs tingling.
 

 He told Fairfax Media he presumed it was because his legs were sore from playing football and the water was cold.
 

 But after coming out of the water about 30 minutes later, he found his legs were covered in tiny sores which were oozing with blood.
 

 Sam Kanizay, 16, emerged from the ocean where he had been soaking his legs to find dozens of tiny bites that would not stop bleeding
 

 Pictured: Sam was treated by medical staff at two hospitals over the weekend, who could not stem the bleeding
 

 It is believed Sam has dozens of pin prick-sized bites on his feet and legs (pictured)
 

 'My first instinct was that I must have stepped on a rock,' he said.
 

 'But I realised that couldn't have been it, because it was evenly distributed over my whole ankle and foot.'
 

 After attempts to stop the bleeding were unsuccessful, the teenager spent his weekend at two different hospitals, where doctors also tried and failed to stop the sores from bleeding.
 

 One nurse advised the bites could be from sea lice, but it was no more than a 'guess'.
 

 WHAT ARE SEA LICE? Pictured: A sea louse Sea lice which cause tiny, pin-prick like bites are a miniscule jellyfish or stinger larvae. They have the same stinging cells as an adult jellyfish, though they can only attack a small area because of their size. Source: Oceanfit .
 

 Sam's father Jarrod said the teenager was a 'stoic kid' and he was expecting his son to make a full recovery
 

 A nurse told the teenager the bites might have been from sea lice, but she was only guessing
 

 Sam's father Jarrod said his son's injury 'fascinated' all of the staff working in the emergency room at Sandringham Hospital.
 

 'They were all on Google afterwards, hypothesising as to what happened,' he said.
 

 'They pretty much had 10 different hypotheses but nothing yet.'
 

 Mr Kanizay told Daily Mail Australia on Sunday night the bleeding had finally stopped, and he had high hopes for a quick and full recovery.
 

 'Sam is a stoic kid, so he will be fine,' he said.
 

 Sam told News Corp he would probably use the pool to ice his legs in the future, but it wouldn't keep him away from the beach completely.
 

 'Plenty of people go for a swim in there so it's probably just a one-off thing,' he said."

 President Donald Trump on Friday said he would name one of the most prominent anti-abortion activists in the country to a top communications post at HHS.
 

 Charmaine Yoest, tapped to be assistant secretary of public affairs, is a senior fellow at American Values. She is the former president of Americans United for Life, which has been instrumental in advancing anti-abortion legislation at the state level to restrict access to the procedure.
 

 Story Continued Below
 

 Her appointment was quickly panned by Democratic lawmakers and prominent abortion rights organizations. The assistant secretary of public affairs shapes communications efforts for the entire agency.
 

 Ms. Yoest has a long record of seeking to undermine womens access to health care and safe, legal abortion by distorting the facts, and her selection shows yet again that this administration is pandering to extreme conservatives and ignoring the millions of men and women nationwide who support womens constitutionally protected health care rights and dont want to go backward,"" Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) said in a statement.
 

 AULs website which states that the group offers state lawmakers 32 different pieces of model legislation to restrict access to abortion characterizes Yoest as public enemy #1 for abortion rights organizations.
 

 It is unacceptable that someone with a history of promoting myths and false information about womens health is appointed to a government position whose main responsibility is to provide the public with accurate and factual information,"" added Dawn Laguens, executive vice president of Planned Parenthood.
 

 Yoests appointment comes at a time when states with Republican governors and GOP-dominated legislatures have enacted a wave of new abortion restrictions, many of which have been blocked in court.
 

 States on average added 57 new abortion restrictions annually between 2011 and 2015, a pace that picked up dramatically following the 2010 midterm elections, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research organization that supports abortion rights.
 

 Republicans currently control both chambers of state legislatures in 32 states, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
 

 Thirty-three states have GOP governors.
 

 Trump has already moved to give anti-abortion groups a win during his first 100 days in office, although Congress has not gained traction fulfilling one of its top priorities: scrapping Planned Parenthood's taxpayer funding.
 

 Trump recently signed into law a resolution overturning an Obama-era rule designed to protect Title X family planning grants for Planned Parenthood. HHS during the Obama administration said 13 states since 2011 have taken actions to restrict participation by family planning providers in Title X because they provide abortions.
 

 Several red states have also tried to cut Planned Parenthood out of their Medicaid programs a strategy that picked up two years ago in response to the release of a series of undercover videos by anti-abortion activists concerning Planned Parenthood and fetal tissue donation. Those defunding efforts have been halted in court.
 

 Yoest isnt the only Trump administration appointee who has expressed critical views about abortion and other social issues. Katy Talento, a health aide for the White House Domestic Policy Council, has taken the controversial view that contraception poses major dangers to women and causes abortion and miscarriages.
 

 Yoest is an HHS political appointee but her appointment does not require Senate confirmation. She succeeds Kevin Griffis, who was recently named vice president of communications for Planned Parenthood.
 

 ""The fact that Yoest will be replacing Kevin Griffis, who now works for Planned Parenthood, is another indication of the dramatic change weve seen in Washington since the election of President Trump,"" Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the anti-abortion group Susan B. Anthony List, said in a statement. ""This is a new era for the pro-life movement and our fight to protect unborn children and their mothers from the horror of abortion."
157,snopes45,0,http://archive.is/zXeMT,"While we were distracted by Trump, Republicans advanced these 9 terrifying bills","The Republican-led Congress is wasting no time forcing through the most horrendous bills seen in decades while Americas eyes are on Russia.
 

 With both houses of Congress solidly under Republican control, theres little in the way to stop House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wisconsin) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Kentucky) from sending bills to President Trumps desk that embody the most dangerous aspects of radical right-wing ideology.
 

 However unlikely these bills passage would have seemed in the 114th Congress, the possibility of these nine bills becoming law is much higher now, especially considering the flurry of headlines around Donald Trumps ties to Russia, Attorney General Jeff Sessions recusal on the ongoing investigation into the presidents Russian connections, and Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyaks multiple meetings with several of Trumps top lieutenants.
 

 Here are the nine worst bills to keep an eye on:
 

 1. H.R. 861: To terminate the Environmental Protection Agency
 

 This bill cosponsored by Republican members of Congress from fossil fuel-producing states is just one sentence long, and says nothing about what would happen to the multiple environmental regulations the EPA has instituted since 1970, or its multibillion-dollar budget, or its thousands of staffers. H.R. 861 is currently awaiting action in the subcommittee on environment.
 

 2. H.R. 610: Tax dollars for private schools
 

 Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) introduced this bill in January, which would redistribute funding earmarked for public schools in the form of vouchers for parents to send children to private schools. Over the long term, this would eventually bankrupt public schools, and create a stratified education system in which cash-strapped public schools would be unable to meet the educational needs of low-income students. The bill is awaiting action in the House Committee on Education and the Workforce.
 

 3. H.R. 899: To terminate the Department of Education
 

 If this bill, introduced by Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Kentucky), becomes law, the U.S. Department of Education would terminate by the end of 2018. The bills brevity leaves many questions unanswered, like what would happen with Department of Education grants for public schools and universities, its budget, or its staff. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos has said she would personally be fine if the agency she heads were to be abolished
 

 4. H.J.R. 69: To repeal a rule protecting wildlife
 

 Rep. Don Young (R-Alaska), whose constituents likely include hunters who kill wildlife for sport rather than for food, introduced this joint resolution voicing displeasure with a Department of Interior rule that prohibits non-subsistence hunting in the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge. The resolution passed the House and is awaiting action in the Senate.
 

 5. H.R. 370: To repeal the Affordable Care Act
 

 While President Obama was in office, House Republicans voted at least 60 times to repeal the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act also known as Obamacare despite its futility. However, the Trump administration has made the repeal of Obamacare a top priority, meaning the repeal bill from Rep. Bill Flores (R-Texas) is likely to pass.
 

 6. H.R. 354: To defund Planned Parenthood
 

 Despite the widely publicized debunking of the video alleging the womens health nonprofit was selling human organs, Republicans are still refusing to stop destroying Planned Parenthood. Rep. Diane Black (R-Tennessee) introduced a bill that would prevent any federal grants from going to Planned Parenthood for a full year unless they swore to not perform abortions. As the chart below from Planned Parenthood shows, only 3 percent of Planned Parenthood resources go toward abortions, while the vast majority of funding is used to help low-income women get STD tests, contraceptive care, and breast cancer screenings:
 

 7. H.R. 785: National Right-to-Work legislation
 

 Conservative ideologue Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) is aiming to cripple unions at the nationwide level with a bill that would systematically deprive labor unions of the funding they need to operate. Unions often provide one of the crucial pillars of support for Democratic candidates and causes, and conservatives aim to destroy them once and for all by going after their funding. Its important to note that right-to-work is bad for all workers, not just union members in 2015, the Economic Policy Institute learned that wages in right-to-work states are roughly 3.2 percent lower than in non-right-to-work states.
 

 8. H.R. 83: Mobilizing Against Sanctuary Cities Act
 

 Multiple cities and states around the country have openly stated that they wont abide by President Trumps plan to aggressively round up and deport undocumented immigrants. A bill by Rep. Lou Barletta (R-Pennsylvania) would strip all federal funding of any city that doesnt obey Trumps immigration policies for up to a year.
 

 9. H.R. 147: To criminalize abortion
 

 Rep. Trent Franks (R-Arizona) wants to aggressively prosecute pregnant women seeking abortions, along with abortion providers, by making abortion a felony punishable by up to five years in prison. The bill is currently awaiting action in the Subcommittee on the Constitution and Civil Justice.
 

 To fight back against these bills, call 202-224-3121, ask for your member of Congress, and tell them to vote no.

But the aviation industry and legislators, including a liberal Democratic senator who helped inspire the provision, said it only reinforces the status quo.
 

 And the provision, part of the Senate Republicans tax plan under consideration this week, is expected by one tally to cost federal coffers $500,000 over 10 years, an infinitesimally small amount in congressional bookkeeping.
 

 The measure exempts private plane management fees from taxation, and relates to a 7.5 percent excise tax paid by commercial airlines on each seat they sell.
 

 Until several years ago, owners of private aircraft using planes for personal or business travel were free from this so-called ticket tax. They did, however, pay management companies to store and fuel their jets, hire crew, train pilots, schedule flights and comply with safety standards."

 Third-grader Logan Autry, 9, said officials at Powers-Ginsburg Elementary School in Fresno told him to remove his Make America Great Again hat because it could stir negative emotions in other children.
 

 The red baseball cap with the phrase printed in white capital letters has become almost synonymous with the campaign of presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.
 

 The principal told me to take it off, and I still didnt take it off, Autry told Fox and Friends on Saturday. And she said it was against the dress code to wear the hat, but I looked in the dress code and it was not against it.
 

 Autrys stepmom, Angela Hoffknecht, said the request to remove the hat came after an older student made a remark about the cap.
 

 They told me to take my hat off because it brings negative emotions to the other children who dont like [Trump], Autry told 11Alive.
 

 The Fresno Unified School District said in a statement it was responsible for providing a safe learning environment.
 

 It is also our responsibility to take precautions when the discourse begins to impact our school climate and interrupt school operations, the statement said.

160,snopes48,0,http://thegrio.com/2015/05/12/fbi-white-supremacists-law-enforcement/,FBI's warning of white supremacists infiltrating law enforcement nearly forgotten,"Because of intensifying civil strife over the recent killings of unarmed black men and boys, many Americans are wondering, Whats wrong with our police? Remarkably, one of the most compelling but unexplored explanations may rest with a FBI warning of October 2006, which reported that White supremacist infiltration of law enforcement represented a significant national threat.
 

 Several key events preceded the report. A federal court found that members of a Los Angeles sheriffs department formed a Neo Nazi gang and habitually terrorized the black community. Later, the Chicago police department fired Jon Burge, a detective with reputed ties to the Ku Klux Klan, after discovering he tortured over 100 black male suspects. Thereafter, the Mayor of Cleveland discovered that many of the city police locker rooms were infested with White Power graffiti. Years later, a Texas sheriff department discovered that two of its deputies were recruiters for the Klan.
 

 In near prophetic fashion, after the FBIs warning, white supremacy extremism in the U.S. increased, exponentially. From 2008 to 2014, the number of white supremacist groups, reportedly, grew from 149 to nearly a thousand, with no apparent abatement in their infiltration of law enforcement.
 

 This year, alone, at least seven San Francisco law enforcement officers were suspended after an investigation revealed they exchanged numerous White Power communications laden with remarks about lynching African-Americans and burning crosses. Three reputed Klan members that served as correction officers were arrested for conspiring to murder a black inmate. At least four Fort Lauderdale police officers were fired after an investigation found that the officers fantasized about killing black suspects.
 

 The United States doesnt publicly track white supremacists, so the full range of their objectives remains murky. Although black and Jewish-Americans are believed to be the foremost targets of white supremacists, recent attacks in Nevada, Wisconsin, Arizona, Kansas and North Carolina, demonstrate that other non-whites, and religious and social minorities, are also vulnerable. Perhaps more alarmingly, in the last several years alone, white supremacists have reportedly murdered law enforcement officers in Arkansas, Nevada and Wisconsin.
 

 In fact, the FBI reports that of the 511 law enforcement officers killed during felony incidents from 2004 to 2013, white citizens killed the majority of them. Of the citizens stopped by law enforcement officers in New York City and Chicago, white citizens were more likely to be found with guns and drugs. Given the white supremacist penchant for violence, guns and drug trafficking, the findings may be an indication that their network is just as destructive and far-reaching as that of foreign terrorist groups.
 

 The unfortunate consequence of todays threat is that a law enforcement officer may be good or bad, a villain or hero; one exceptionally prone to exhibit malicious forms of racial hatred, or distinctively suited to protect the racially oppressed. But the paradox doesnt end there.
 

 The white supremacist threat brings to light a dark feature of the American experience that some believed extinct. It rouses ingrained notions of distrusts between police and communities of color while bringing to bear the vital interest citizens of good will share in the complete abolishment of race as a judgmental factor.
 

 As the nation struggles to resolve the perplexities of police brutality, the white supremacist threat should inform all Americans that todays civil discord is not borne out of a robust animosity towards law enforcement, most of whom are professional. Rather, its more representative of a centuries-old ideological clash, which has ignited in citizens of good will a desire to affirm notions of racial equality so that the moral ethos of American culture is a reality for all.

161,snopes49,0,http://newsweekme.com/saudi-move-relax-male-guardianship-welcomed-womens-advocates/,Saudi move to relax male guardianship welcomed by womens advocates,"A move by Saudi Arabia to give women more control over their life choices by further relaxing a controversial male guardian system was tentatively welcomed on Friday as another small step for women in the conservative kingdom.
 

 Saudi Arabia is well known as one of the worlds most gender-segregated nations, where women live under the supervision of a male guardian, cannot drive, and in public must wear head-to-toe black garments.
 

 Women need approval from a man to travel, study and get some health treatments.
 

 However local media outlets reported this week that the king of Saudi Arabia has issued an order allowing women to benefit from government services such as education and healthcare without getting the consent of a male guardian.
 

 This means women could, in some circumstances, study and access hospital treatment, work in the public and private sector and represent themselves in court without consent of a male guardian, said Maha Akeel, a womens rights campaigner and a director at Jeddah-based Organization of Islamic Cooperation.
 

 Now at least it opens the door for discussion on the guardian system, Akeel told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Women are independent and can take care of themselves.
 

 This comes as the latest in a series of moves in Saudi Arabia to include women more in the workforce as the kingdom moves to diversify its economy and cut reliance on oil.
 

 The trend started in 2011 when the late King Abdullah allowed women onto the government advisory Shura Council. Women can now vote in municipal elections, work in some retail and hospitality jobs and were allowed to compete in the Olympics for the first time in 2012.
 

 However Saudi Arabia was still ranked 141 of 144 countries in the 2016 Global Gender Gap, a World Economic Forum study on how women fare in economic and political participation, healthand education.
 

 The system of make guardianship, which requires women to obtain permission from a guardian father, husband, or son to travel, study or marry is an impediment to realising womens rights, say rights groups.
 

 Male guardianship is un-Islamic and humiliating for women, said Akeel. Some (men) take advantage of this male guardianship for their own benefit and abuse it."

Thirty years ago, Pat Nixon caught Donald Trump on Phil Donahues TV show  because of course she did  and she was very impressed with what she saw. So impressed that her husband, the former president, went out of his way to write the young tycoon a note.

In typical Nixon fashion, he begins by saying that he didnt actually see anything.

I did not see the program, wrote Nixon. But Mrs. Nixon told me you were great.

Then a bit of friendly encouragement:

As you can imagine, she is an expert on politics and she predicts that whenever you decide to run for office, you will be a winner!

In a Trumpian flourish, Nixon underlines great with a pen  though come to think of it, Trump might have done that one himself.

 Welcome to Israel. Its a honor to meet you in our country. I will be glad to sit with you for a business meeting and I hope one day I will visit you in the White House.

 I am thankful for meeting you Mister Trump. Enjoy your stay. Trust you.

 Before Trump left, he wished the girl a fast recovery.

 Despite the vast press entourage that followed Trump, the visit was never noted in the mainstream media, a contrast one commentator seized upon."
164,snopes51,0,http://www.cnn.com/2017/08/25/us/hurricane-harvey/index.html,Hurricane Harvey makes landfall,"Hurricane Harvey made landfall Friday night between Port Aransas and Port O'Connor, Texas, as a Category 4 storm with winds of 130 mph, the National Hurricane Center said.
 

 Harvey is the first Category 4 hurricane to make landfall in the United States since Hurricane Charley in 2004.
 

 The storm is poundng the Texas coast and its millions of residents with hurricane-force winds knocking down trees, power poles and signs, and with torrential rain deluging streets.
 

 In its 11 p.m. ET update, the National Hurricane Center said the center of the storm had passed over San Jose Island, bringing with it a dangerous and powerful eye wall.
 

 The hurricane center warns that some areas will see as much as 13 feet of storm surge and large, destructive waves.
 

 And there's the rain that the slow-moving storm is expected to produce. Because it is expected to come to a near halt inland, Harvey could drop as much as 40 inches of rain in some places, and up to 30 inches in others, by Wednesday.
 

 The combination of wind and water could leave wide swaths of South Texas ""uninhabitable for weeks or months,"" the National Weather Service in Houston said.
 

 Such daunting language hasn't been seen by CNN's experts since Hurricane Katrina , which left more than 1,800 people dead in 2005.
 

 The threat has prompted officials in at least one town to ask residents who stay behind to write their Social Security numbers on one of their arms in case. It will make identifying bodies easier.
 

 ""Texas is about to have a very significant disaster,"" said Brock Long, director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
 

 Gov. Greg Abbott warned of record-setting flooding and called on people to flee the area before the storm hits.
 

 ""My top goal is to be able to make it through this storm in a way in which we lose no lives,"" Abbott said. ""Put your life first and your property second.""
 

 The golden arches atop a McDonald's in Galveston were downed by high winds.
 

 Residents were urged to evacuate. A mass exodus from the coast caused extensive traffic jams along the state's highways, while other people boarded up windows and stocked up on food and water ahead of the storm, the effects of which are expected to last for days.
 

 The storm will stall and dump rain on South Texas and parts of Louisiana into the middle of next week, forecasters predicted.
 

 Latest developments
 

 -- Rockport, Texas, officials are advising residents who refuse to evacuate to write their names and Social Security number on a forearm, Mayor Pro Tem Patrick Rios told CNN. Rios said it will ""help out first responders should they find a body.""
 

 -- The National Weather Service in Corpus Christi issued an extreme wind warning for portions of the Texas coast. ""Widespread destructive winds of 115 to 145 mph will produce swaths of tornado-like damage,"" the agency said.
 

 -- Texas' governor requested additional federal help with a presidential disaster declaration. The White House is considering the declaration.
 

 -- President Donald Trump, who will visit the area next week, has signed a disaster declaration for the state.
 

 FEMA prepared for 'significant disaster'
 

 Those who stay should ""elevate and get into a structure that can withstand potentially Category 3 winds from a hurricane,"" said Long, the FEMA director.
 

 ""The bottom line message is, right now, if people have not heeded the warning, again, their window to do so is closing,"" Long said. ""If they refuse to heed the warning, that's on them.""
 

 Long said he is ""very worried"" about storm surge, or ""wind-driven water,"" slamming coastal areas, saying it has the ""highest potential to kill the most amount of people and cause the most amount of damage.""
 

 Trump tweeted that he has spoken with the governors of Texas and Louisiana, saying he is ""closely monitoring Hurricane Harvey developments and here to assist as needed.""
 

 Record flooding expected
 

 Christopher Beafneaux, left, Ernesto Villarreal, center, and Roman Lopez board up windows of a business in Galveston.
 

 Officials worried that Harvey's deluge of rain will drench Texas and the region for several days.
 

 ""We could see this storm park for almost five days in some places, and we hear three feet of rain,"" said Bill Read, the former director of the National Hurricane Center. ""That's just going to be a huge problem for these areas.""
 

 ""The water is going to be the issue,"" Corpus Christi Mayor Joe McComb said. ""We've never had anything like this.""
 

 Harvey is also causing concern in New Orleans, where heavy rain could usher in as much as 20 inches of rain through early next week and overwhelm the city's already-compromised drainage system
 

 Storm nears shore
 

 Joey Walker, 25, works with the Galveston Island Beach Patrol and is riding out the storm from a house on Galveston Island. He posted video of near-white out conditions overlooking Stewart Beach.
 

 Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner said anyone not leaving should plan to stay off the roads once the storm starts.
 

 ""People need to know, this is not a one-, two-day event and done,"" Turner said.
 

 'I'm trying to be strong'
 

 The threat of Harvey became evident Thursday when several coastal Texas counties issued evacuation orders, leading to hordes of residents sitting bumper to bumper for miles.
 

 Traffic on Interstate 37 between San Antonio and Corpus Christi was backed up for miles Thursday.
 

 Rose Yepez told CNN it took her twice as long as usual to drive 140 miles from Corpus Christi to San Antonio, en route to Texas Hill Country.
 

 Private vehicles -- along with city buses packed with adults and children carrying backpacks -- jammed roads for hours.
 

 ""I'm shaking inside, but for them, I'm trying to be strong,"" a Corpus Christi woman who was waiting with her two daughters to board a bus out of town told CNN affiliate KRIS.
 

 Workers at 39 offshore petroleum production platforms and an oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico also evacuated Thursday, the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement said.
 

 A sign reading ""Be Nice Harvey"" was left behind on a boarded-up business in Port Aransas.
 

 First responders such as Brittany Fowler stayed behind and waited for the storm.
 

 ""Hopefully, it doesn't do any damage, but if it does, we've prepared,"" Fowler, a firefighter in Corpus Christi, wrote on Instagram.
 

 Fowler's family helped by boarding up windows and doors at her home, and she bought plenty of water, food and a small power generator.
 

 Special thank you to my Dad, brother and Marz for boarding up the house and getting it squared away for #Harvey!

 Despite the warnings, Elsie and David Reichenbacher prepped supplies and planned to stay put in Corpus Christi.
 

 ""I've gone through a lot of hurricanes. I've lived here most of my life,"" Elsie Reichenbacher said. ""I'd rather take care of my home and my animals and be safe here. I'm on high ground with my house."""

Wall Street is breathing down companies necks to cut costs, and the labor savings in Mexico is too great.
 

 Mr. Trump first announced he was talking to Carrier on Thanksgiving Day via Twitter, which the company quickly confirmed. The discussions have continued this week, and with a tentative deal in hand on Tuesday, transition officials scheduled Mr. Trumps and Mr. Pences visit to Indianapolis.
 

 I didnt think it would be this quick, Mr. Maynard said.
 

 While the standoff loomed large in the lives of its employees in Indiana, for United Technologies the forgone savings is tiny equivalent to about 2 cents per share in earnings.
 

 Every penny counts, but if we step back and Im looking at earnings of $6.60 per share this year, 2 cents is an easy concession if the president-elect listens to some of the companys bigger concerns, said Howard Rubel, a senior equity analyst with Jefferies, an investment banking firm in New York.
 

 When Carrier announced in February that the two Indiana factories would be closing, it did offer benefits to employees facing layoffs, including paying for them to go back to school and retrain for other careers. Even with that, however, once the layoffs were to begin in mid-2017, most of the workers would have had a hard time finding jobs that paid anywhere near the $20 to $25 an hour that veteran line workers earn.
 

 Carrier is best known for its air-conditioners, but it also sells a variety of other heating and cooling equipment for homes and businesses, like the gas furnaces and fan coils for electric furnaces made at the Indianapolis factory. The jobs in Indiana Mr. Trump has referred to are in two separate sites the Carrier plant in Indianapolis, with 1,400 employees, and a United Technologies factory in Huntington, Ind., with 700."
166,snopes53,0,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/04/us/politics/supreme-court-sides-with-baker-who-turned-away-gay-couple.html,"In Narrow Decision, Supreme Court Sides With Baker Who Turned Away Gay Couple","WASHINGTON The Supreme Court on Monday ruled in favor of a Colorado baker who had refused to create a wedding cake for a gay couple. The courts decision was narrow, and it left open the larger question of whether a business can discriminate against gay men and lesbians based on rights protected by the First Amendment.
 

 The court passed on an opportunity to either bolster the right to same-sex marriage or explain how far the government can go in regulating businesses run on religious principles. Instead, Justice Anthony M. Kennedys majority opinion turned on the argument that the Colorado Civil Rights Commission, which originally ruled against the baker, had been shown to be hostile to religion because of the remarks of one of its members.
 

 At the same time, Justice Kennedy strongly reaffirmed protections for gay rights.
 

 The outcome of cases like this in other circumstances must await further elaboration in the courts, he wrote, all in the context of recognizing that these disputes must be resolved with tolerance, without undue disrespect to sincere religious beliefs, and without subjecting gay persons to indignities when they seek goods and services in an open market.
 

 Justice Kennedy often casts the deciding vote in closely divided cases on major social issues. When the court agreed to hear the Colorado case last June, it seemed to present him with a stark choice between two of his core commitments. On the one hand, Justice Kennedy has written every major Supreme Court decision protecting gay men and lesbians. On the other, he is the courts most ardent defender of free speech."
167,snopes54,0,http://archive.is/aWxSQ,San Anselmos San Domenico School creates stir by removing Catholic statues,"Removal of a number of statues and other smaller Catholic icons from the campus of San Domenico School in San Anselmo has raised concerns among some parents.
 

 In an email to the schools board of directors, Dominican Sisters of San Rafael and the head of school, Shannon Fitzpatrick objected to the removal of the statues and other steps the school has taken in an effort to make the school more inclusive.
 

 Articulating an inclusive foundation appears to mean letting go of San Domenicos 167-year tradition as a Dominican Catholic school and being both afraid and ashamed to celebrate ones heritage and beliefs, wrote Fitzpatrick, whose 8-year-old son attends the school.
 

 She added, In our time here, the word Catholic has been removed from the mission statement, sacraments were removed from the curriculum, the lower school curriculum was changed to world religions, the logo and colors were changed to be less Catholic, and the uniform was changed to be less Catholic.
 

 Responding to follow-up questions Monday, Fitzpatrick wrote, There are other families having the same concerns I do. Many parents feel if the school is heading in a different direction then the San Domenico community should have been notified before the signing of the enrollment for the following year.
 

 Cheryl Newell, who had four children graduate from San Domenico, said, I am extremely disappointed in the school and the direction theyve been going. This isnt a new thing that theyve been intentionally eroding their Catholic heritage. Theyre trying to be something for everyone and theyre making no one happy,
 

 Ceremony
 

 Kim Pipki, whose daughter left San Domenico two years ago after graduating from ninth grade, said some of the statues were also important to families who arent Catholic.
 

 The one main statue that has everyone fired up is the baby Jesus and Mary one, Pipki said. It was at the center of the primary school courtyard.
 

 Pipki said the school had a ceremony during which children would place a crown on the statue of Mary.
 

 It was less about God and more about passing on some traditions, Pipki said. People were shocked that the statues were pitched in the basement.
 

 Amy Skewes-Cox, who heads San Domenico Schools board of trustees, said the relocation and removal of some of the schools 180 religious icons was completely in compliance with San Domenicos new strategic plan, approved unanimously by the board of trustees and the Dominican Sisters of San Rafael last year. She said at least 18 icons remain, including a statue of St. Dominic at the center of the campus.
 

 She noted that it was unfortunate the removal of the statues occurred at about the same time as the unrest in Charlottesville over the removal of a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee, and that the issues are totally different and have absolutely no connection other than it is change, and people have a hard time with change.
 

 All faiths
 

 Sister Maureen McInerney, prioress general of the Dominican Sisters of San Rafael, said she hadnt visited the campus lately and was under the impression statues had been relocated on campus rather than removed entirely.
 

 I try not to get into the details of the operation. That really isnt my place, McInerney said. So if there has been a reduction in the number of statues but there are still many statues around the campus, I think that would be fine.
 

 San Domenico is a Catholic school; it also welcomes people of all faiths, McInerney said. It is making an effort to be inclusive of all faiths.
 

 One of the strategic plans stated goals is to strengthen San Domenicos identity as an independent school and clearly articulate its inclusive spiritual foundation.
 

 San Domenico was founded by the Dominican Sisters in 1850 as an independent, Catholic school meaning that it is not owned or operated by a parish or religious order.
 

 San Domenico is both a Catholic school and an independent school, said Head of School Cecily Stock, but what we were finding after doing some research is that in the broader community we are known as being a Catholic school and are not necessarily known as an independent school. We want to make sure that prospective families are aware that we are an independent school.
 
 

 Of the 660 students who attend the K-12 school, 121 are boarding students and 98 of these are international students from British Columbia, Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Mexico, Korea, Thailand and Vietnam. The students attending San Domenico come from a variety of religious backgrounds besides Christianity: Judaism, Buddhism, Hinduism and Islam.
 

 Stock said schools operated by the Catholic Church, such as St. Isabella, Marin Catholic and St. Anselm, tend to have larger class sizes and lower tuition costs. Tuition for an incoming kindergarten student at San Domenico is $29,850.
 

 Skewes-Cox said, If you walk on the campus and the first thing you confront is three or four statues of St. Dominic or St. Francis, it could be alienating for that other religion, and we didnt want to further that feeling.
 

 Stock said the parents of some prospective students who visited the campus expressed concern about this.
 

 In her email to the school, Fitzpatrick wrote that she became concerned with the direction of San Domenico when it removed first reconciliation and first communion from the second-grade curriculum, last year.
 

 Stock said the year before last the school began offering catechism after school and then last year phased it out entirely.
 

 We had very few families interested. I think last year it was fewer than five, Stock said. It just made sense to have the students prepare for communion with their local parishes where they would be with a larger group of students.
 

 Stock said, Over the last few years weve had fewer Catholic students as part of the community and a larger number of students of various faith traditions. Right now about 80 percent of our families do not identify as Catholic.
 

 World religions
 

 Rather than indoctrinate students in Catholic theology, San Domenico provides students with instruction in world religions and philosophy.
 

 Its really about empowering each student and giving them the information so they can discover their own purpose, their own truth, Stock said. We believe the best way to understand your own faith is to learn about the faiths of others.
 

 Mirza Khan, the schools director of philosophy, ethics and world religions, said, The Dominican teaching philosophy is not to teach there is only one truth. It is to foster conversation, to intentionally invite in participants that have different perspectives in a very open-ended process of philosophical and spiritual inquiry. That has been a long-standing part of the Dominican tradition.
 

 Khan, whose father and grandfather were Sufi teachers in India, received a bachelors degree in comparative religion at Bard College. Before becoming a teacher at San Domenico about 10 years ago, he worked as a research assistant to a professor at Hebrew University in Jerusalem.
 

 Khan said during his time in Jerusalem he got to see first-hand how devastating it can be when religions are in conflict."

 The glittering Las Vegas strip is not an obvious model for energy conservation.
 

 

 

 Yet hidden above the glowing Eiffel Tower, neon resort awnings and a black pyramid that shines a beam of light into space, is one of the largest rooftop solar arrays in the country.
 

 Nevada solar industry collapses after state lets power company raise fees Read more
 

 Twenty acres of sun-catching glass sit atop the Mandalay Bay convention center, and when new installations are complete, it will become the biggest rooftop solar array in the US.
 

 In recent months, three of Nevadas largest casino companies MGM Resorts, Wynn, and Las Vegas Sands have announced plans to buy and produce more renewable energy for their hotels, a move driven both by increasing demand for responsible energy use from the companies that rent their conference halls, and a surplus of cheap power from solar farms in Nevada and California.
 

 Its no accident that we put the array on top of a conference center. This is good business for us, said Cindy Ortega, chief sustainability officer at MGM Resorts. We are looking at leaving the power system, and one of the reasons for that is we can procure more renewable energy on the open market.
 

 But there is a big shadow lurking over a rapid greening of the Las Vegas strip. Regulators will not let casinos simply walk away from the states monopoly utility provider, NV Energy.
 

 Together, the casinos 15 properties account for 7% of NV Energys electricity sales, and if that income were lost, the utility says, its remaining customers would have to endure significant rate hikes. As a result, the public utility commission (PUC) of Nevada is demanding resorts pay tens of millions of dollars to leave NV Energys services, a December 2015 decision which one casino has appealed.

 Las Vegass power drama captures an ongoing dilemma in the new energy economy. While corporations have been encouraged to go green, their efforts pass the burden of subsidizing old utility regimes on to retail consumers, which regulators cannot allow.
 

 Its no accident that we put the [solar] array on top of a conference center. This is good business for us Cindy Ortega, MGM Resorts
 

 They need to maintain the grid. You cannot let these utilities go bankrupt or else every business in the city dies, said Bill Ellard, an energy economist for the American Solar Energy Society. What will happen if they dont maintain the grid properly and the transformers blow?
 

 In December, Nevadas three-member PUC effectively destroyed a thriving rooftop solar industry by approving NV Energys request to drastically lower the rate at which solar users are compensated for excess energy they provide to the grid.
 

 This is what I call a death spiral for utilities, said Ellard. They make it hard to go solar because once you defect from them, that affects revenue. Then they increase rates on everybody else, forcing them to defect.
 

 MGM Resorts has already hurt utility profits though an ambitious energy conservation effort. In addition to building a solar array strong enough to power 1,000 homes for one year, the corporation is replacing 1.3m light bulbs in its properties with LEDs.
 

 But to power multi-thousand-room resorts which house nightclubs, pools, theaters and slot machine-packed casinos would require more solar panels than the companies have rooftop space. They are consequently joining a trend in big energy consumers requesting to buy electricity outside the utility system.
 

 They are all very concerned with their bottom lines, said Rebecca Wagner, a former member of Nevadas PUC. The energy market in the west is great right now, so they are seeking to curb costs by getting in that market.
 

 Cheap natural gas is probably driving the initiative more than anything else, Wagner says. But according to Ellard, the antipathy casinos have for NV Energys monopoly also previews the next phase in an energy economy where renewables are competitive with fossil fuel prices.
 

 Its complex because its not just electricity, he said. Its natural gas, wind, coal, smart grid, big data, oil its all connected. Were at this next change point where wind and solar [battery] storage and smart software are going to start to replace all those energy sources.

 If the resorts do decide to separate from NV Energy, it will still cost them a combined $126.5m, a price set by the PUC which they say is necessary to prevent broad consumer rate hikes and to compensate the utility provider for losses incurred on power plants and other assets purchased with casino demand in mind.
 

 The resorts have complained that this exit fee is too high and perhaps even illegal. The PUC has simply made up rules as it goes along so as to discourage any applicants from exiting [NV Energys] service, Wynn lawyers stated in a January judicial appeal. (MGM and the Las Vegas Sands are considering their options.)
 

 Wynns president, Matthew Maddox, also noted in PUC testimony that NV Energy is owned by Warren Buffetts company, Berkshire Hathaway (based in Omaha, Nebraska), and is therefore, in his estimation, more concerned with maximizing profits than with maintaining Nevadas grid. Maddox pointed out that their money doesnt even stay in Nevada, saying: it goes to Omaha.
 

 Nevadans are subsidizing NV Energys green investments while it lobbies against private rooftop solar installations
 

 Data storage company Switch faced a similar situation last year when it announced plans to use 100% renewable energy to power its giant computer servers. NV Energy was not able to meet those energy demands, and the PUC said the company would have to pay $27m to break up with the utility provider since its large data centers amounted to nearly 3% of NV Energys electricity sales. As a compromise, Switch is paying the utility company to build a new solar array in North Las Vegas to meet their sustainability goals.
 

 The city of Las Vegas, too, is planning to use 100% renewable energy to power its municipal buildings, fire stations, city parks and streetlights by 2017. That would make Las Vegas the largest US city to achieve such a goal. But to get PUC approval, it also had to promise to buy most of the power from an NV Energy solar plant in nearby Boulder City. Nevadans are thus subsidizing NV Energys green investments while it lobbies against private rooftop solar installations by their customers.
 

 MGM Resortss sustainability chief, Ortega, would not comment on her companys wrangling with NV Energy and the PUC. But she did endorse the broad push toward sustainability as a way to combat notions that Sin City lacks a conscience. The more we can dispel the myths around Las Vegas the better destination it is, Ortega said.
 

 We have the ability to educate a wide variety of stakeholders on how we can exponentially reduce environmental impacts, she added. Las Vegas is the perfect place to do that because we have 40 million people come here every single year, and so what better place to start telling that story."
169,snopes56,0,http://www.patheos.com/blogs/progressivesecularhumanist/2017/03/oklahoma-lawmaker-rape-incest-will-god/,Oklahoma Lawmaker: Rape and Incest are the Will of God,"Oklahoma State Rep. George Faught argues that rape and incest are the will of God while defending anti-abortion legislation.
 

 Tuesday the Oklahoma House approved House Bill 1549, also called the Prenatal Nondiscrimination act of 2017. The controversial legislation would prohibit abortion when the fetus is diagnosed with Down syndrome or any other birth defect.
 

 Discussing the legislation before Tuesdays vote, Faught, the bills author, said when it comes to abortion, people are being allowed to play God.
 

 While discussing Faughts legislation on the House floor Rep. Regina Goodwin asked:
 

 At what point did you decide that thats within your ability to decide for all women in Oklahoma?
 

 Faught replied:
 

 One of the things that I campaigned on was to protect life, and I believe life begins at conception.
 

 At one point Rep. Cory Williams (D) asked Faught if rape is the will of God.
 

 Faught responded:
 

 Well, you know, if you read the Bible, theres actually a couple circumstances where that happened. The Lord uses all circumstances. I mean, you can go down that path, but its a reality unfortunately.
 

 Williams followed up, asking if incest is the will of God.
 

 Faught said:
 

 Same answer. Doesnt deal with this bill.
 

 Williams continued, asking why the bill does not include exceptions for rape and incest which are allowed in most anti-abortion legislation:
 

 You wont make any exceptions for rape. You wont make any exceptions for incest, and you are proffering divine intervention as a reason why you wont do that.
 

 Williams Continued:
 

 I think it is very important (to know), do you believe rape and incest are actually the will of God?
 

 After a brief pause, Faught replied:
 

 You know its a great question to ask. And obviously if it happens in someones life, it may not be the best thing that ever happened, but so youre saying that God is not sovereign with every activity that happens in someones life and cant use anything and everything in someones life and I disagree with that.
 

 Bottom line: For Rep. Faught, God is sovereign, and everything that happens is part of Gods plan even rape and incest. Sounds like Faughts God is a moral monster. Good thing God doesnt exist, but it is terrifying that legislators like Faught are making laws based on their ridiculous and dangerous religious superstitions.

 A report released on Monday contains an email exchange between two senior officials at British-based contractor Britam Defence where a scheme 'approved by Washington' is outlined explaining that Qatar would fund rebel forces in Syria to use chemical weapons.
 

 Barack Obama made it clear to Syrian president Bashar al-Assad last month that the U.S. would not tolerate Syria using chemical weapons against its own people.

 According to Infowars.com , the December 25 email was sent from Britam's Business Development Director David Goulding to company founder Philip Doughty.
 

 

 

 It reads: 'Phil... Weve got a new offer. Its about Syria again. Qataris propose an attractive deal and swear that the idea is approved by Washington.
 

 'Well have to deliver a CW to Homs, a Soviet origin g-shell from Libya similar to those that Assad should have.
 

 'They want us to deploy our Ukrainian personnel that should speak Russian and make a video record.

 The U.S. State Department had not returned a request for comment on the alleged emails to MailOnline today at time of publication.
 

 

 

 However the use of chemical warfare was raised at a press briefing in D.C. on January 28.
 

 A spokesman said that the U.S. joined the international community in 'setting common redlines about the consequences of using chemical weapons'.

 Devastation: People gather at a site hit by what activists said was missiles fired by a Syrian Air Force fighter jet from forces loyal to Assad, at the souk of Azaz, north of Aleppo on January 13
 

 A leaked U.S. government cable revealed that the Syrian army more than likely had used chemical weapons during an attack in the city of Homs in December.
 

 

 

 The document, revealed in The Cable , revealed the findings of an investigation by Scott Frederic Kilner, the U.S. consul general in Istanbul, into accusations that the Syrian army used chemical weapons in the December 23 attack.
 

 An Obama administration official who had access to the document was reported as saying: 'We can't definitely say 100 per cent, but Syrian contacts made a compelling case that Agent 15 was used in Homs on Dec. 23.'
 

 Mr Kilner's investigation included interviews with civilians, doctors, and rebels present during the attack, as well as the former general and head of the Syrian WMD program, Mustafa al-Sheikh.
 

 Dr. Nashwan Abu Abdo, a neurologist in Homs, is certain chemical weapons were used. He told The Cable: 'It was a chemical weapon, we are sure of that, because tear gas can't cause the death of people.'
 

 Threats: Barack Obama said during a speech last month that if Syria used chemical weapons against its own people it would be 'totally unacceptable'
 

 Tyrant: Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad, pictured with his wife Asma, is facing increasing international pressure over his brutal massacre of his own people
 

 Eye witness accounts from the investigation revealed that a tank launched chemical weapons and caused people exposed to them to suffer nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, delirium, seizures, and respiratory distress.
 

 The symptoms suggest that the weaponized compound Agent-15 was responsible. Syria denied using chemical weapons and said it would never use them against citizens.
 

 Speaking to Pentagon reporters at the time, Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said his biggest concern was how the U.S. and allies would secure the chemical and biological weapons sites scattered across Syria and ensure the components don't end up in the wrong hands if the regime falls, particularly under violent conditions.
 

 Government forces and rebels in Syria have both been accused by human rights groups of carrying out brutal warfare in the 22-month-old conflict, which has claimed more than 60,000 lives."

We have plenty of space in our country, but insufficient resources to support everyone who wants to come here. When we see innocent children used as political pawns, it still tugs at our heartstrings, which is the desired intent. The real question is: What are we going to do about it? Immigration reform has been a very tough issue, as well as a political football, and it has produced governmental stalemates and no useful solutions for decades.
 

 President Obamas decision to act unilaterally outside of Congress is not the answer. Instead, Congress must use its lawmaking powers to fix a system that is so broken that only a legislative solution can fix it. The lack of policy progress has been incredibly frustrating, and the humanitarian border crisis this summer only highlighted how badly we need a system that deals efficiently and effectively with both illegal and legal immigration.
 

 It is time for Congress to act and to do so in a bipartisan fashion that engenders the confidence of the American people. There are many common-sense prescriptions within reach of our government. It is time to seize them.
 

 To begin to solve this problem, we must first have some understanding of why it exists. Despite all of its problems, America is still the place of dreams. As such, it is small wonder that so many from other nations would like to live here.
 

 Right now, we have very porous borders and unenthusiastic and inconsistent enforcement of immigration laws. Further incentives for illegal immigration are easy enrollment in public schools, easy employment for those willing to take jobs others dont want, easy access to health care and easy acquisition of public support through welfare programs. Yet this population cannot participate in the formal workforce, which means they cannot contribute fully to their local economies.
 

 Any discussion of immigration reform should include bipartisan solutions that both address the undocumented population here today and discourage illegal immigration going forward. If these issues are not addressed, solutions will fall short. On the other hand, if all of these issues are addressed firmly and consistently, we can uphold the rule of law and discourage further illegal immigration. Detractors will say that if it were that simple, it already would have been done and we wouldnt be having this discussion. What they fail to account for is the fact that the issues have not been addressed.
 

 A national guest-worker program makes sense and seems to work well in Canada. Non-citizens would have to apply for a guest-worker permit and have a guaranteed job awaiting them. Taxes would be paid at a rate commensurate with other U.S. workers, and special visas would allow for easy entry and egress across borders. Guest-worker status would be granted to individuals and not to groups.
 

 People already here illegally could apply for guest-worker status from outside of the country. This means they would have to leave first. They should in no way be rewarded for having broken our laws, but if they are wise, they will arrange with their employer before they leave to immediately offer them a legal job as soon as their application is received. When they return, they still would not be U.S. citizens, but they would be legal, and they would be paying taxes. Only jobs that are vacant as a result of a lack of interest by American citizens should be eligible for the guest-worker program.
 

 In return for greater certainty on immigration, employers must bear some responsibility for making sure that no illegal immigrants are hired. Employers who break the rules should receive swift, severe and consistent punishment that constitutes a real deterrent and not a mere inconvenience. A second infraction should be a criminal offense and treated as such.
 

 All of this is irrelevant unless we have secure borders. There is much that can be learned from security personnel in prisons and other secured facilities, and there is a great deal of smart technology that can be employed to achieve secure borders. It is a matter of will rather than ability.
 

 As long as we reward people who break laws, they will continue to break laws. We do need a continual flow of immigrants, but choosers need not be beggars. We make decisions based on our needs. People who refuse to comply with the rules must forfeit chances of legalization in the future. Anyone caught involved in voter fraud should be immediately deported and have his citizenship revoked. The point is this: We must create a system that disincentivizes illegal immigration and upholds the rule of law while providing us with a steady stream of immigrants from other nations who will strengthen our society. Lets solve the problem and stop playing political football."
172,snopes59,0,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/06/science/colorados-push-against-teenage-pregnancies-is-a-startling-success.html,Colorado’s Effort Against Teenage Pregnancies Is a Startling Success,"Over the past six years, Colorado has conducted one of the largest experiments with long-acting birth control. If teenagers and poor women were offered free intrauterine devices and implants that prevent pregnancy for years, state officials asked, would those women choose them?

They did in a big way, and the results were startling. The birthrate among teenagers across the state plunged by 40 percent from 2009 to 2013, while their rate of abortions fell by 42 percent, according to the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment. There was a similar decline in births for another group particularly vulnerable to unplanned pregnancies: unmarried women under 25 who have not finished high school.

“Our demographer came into my office with a chart and said, ‘Greta, look at this, we’ve never seen this before,’ ” said Greta Klingler, the family planning supervisor for the public health department. “The numbers were plummeting.”

The changes were particularly pronounced in the poorest areas of the state, places like Walsenburg, a small city in southern Colorado where jobs are scarce and many young women have unplanned pregnancies. Taking advantage of the free program, Hope Martinez, a 20-year-old nursing home receptionist here, recently had a small rod implanted under the skin of her upper arm to prevent pregnancy for three years. She has big plans — to marry, to move farther west and to become a dental hygienist.

“I don’t want any babies for a while,” she said.

More young women are making that choice. In 2009, half of all first births to women in the poorest areas of the state happened before they turned 21. By 2014, half of first births did not occur until the women had turned 24, a difference that advocates say gives young women time to finish their educations and to gain a foothold in an increasingly competitive job market.

“If we want to reduce poverty, one of the simplest, fastest and cheapest things we could do would be to make sure that as few people as possible become parents before they actually want to,” said Isabel Sawhill, an economist at the Brookings Institution. She argues in her 2014 book, “Generation Unbound: Drifting Into Sex and Parenthood Without Marriage,” that single parenthood is a principal driver of inequality and long-acting birth control is a powerful tool to prevent it.

Teenage births have been declining nationally, but experts say the timing and magnitude of the reductions in Colorado are a strong indication that the state’s program was a major driver. About one-fifth of women ages 18 to 44 in Colorado now use a long-acting method, a substantial increase driven largely by teenagers and poor women.


The surge in Colorado has far outpaced the growing use of such methods nationwide. About 7 percent of American women ages 15 to 44 used long-acting birth control from 2011 to 2013, the most recent period studied, up from 1.5 percent in 2002. The figures include all women, even those who were pregnant or sterilized. The share of long-acting contraception users among just women using birth control is likely to be higher.

But the experiment in Colorado is entering an uncertain new phase that will test a central promise of the Affordable Care Act: free contraception.

The private grant that funds the state program has started to run out, and while many young women are expected to be covered under the health care law, some plans have required payment or offered only certain methods, problems the Obama administration is trying to correct. What is more, only new plans must provide free contraception, so women on plans that predate the law may not qualify. (In 2014, about a quarter of people covered through their employers were on grandfathered plans, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.)

Advocates also worry that teenagers — who can get the devices at clinics confidentially — may be less likely to get the devices through their parents’ insurance. Long-acting devices can cost between $800 and $900.

“There’s no lifeboat with the Affordable Care Act,” said Liz Romer, a nurse practitioner who runs the Adolescent Family Planning Clinic at Children’s Hospital Colorado, which went from giving out 30 long-acting devices a year in 2009 to more than 2,000 in 2013.

The state failed to get additional funding through the General Assembly this spring, a shortfall Ms. Klingler said would slow, but not stop, its progress.

Women’s health advocates contend that long-acting birth control is giving American women more say over when — and with whom — they have children. About half of the 6.6 million pregnancies a year in the United States are unintended. Teenage births may be down, but unplanned births have simply moved up the age scale, Ms. Sawhill said, and having a baby before finishing college can be just as risky to a woman’s future as having one while in high school.

Colorado’s program, funded by a private grant from the Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation, named for the billionaire investor Warren Buffett’s late wife, was the real-world version of a research study in St. Louis (also paid for by the foundation, which does not publicly acknowledge its role). The study came to the same conclusion: Women overwhelmingly chose the long-acting methods, and pregnancy and abortion rates plunged.

“The difference in effectiveness is profound,” said Dr. Jeffrey Peipert, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Washington University in St. Louis, who ran the study. The failure rate for the pill was about 5 percent, compared with less than 1 percent for implants and IUDs.

The methods are effective because, unlike the pill, a diaphragm or condoms, they do not require a woman to take action to work. And while an early incarnation, the Dalkon Shield introduced in the 1970s, had disastrous results, the modern devices are safe and have been increasingly promoted by doctors. Last fall, the American Academy of Pediatrics published guidelines that for the first time singled them out as a “first-line” birth control option for adolescents, citing their “efficacy, safety and ease of use.”

“There’s been a big shift in the mind-set,” said Dr. Laura MacIsaac, director of family planning for Mount Sinai Beth Israel in New York. “The demand is coming from everywhere now.”

In Walsenburg, studded with boarded-up buildings and weedy parking lots, advocates have used the Buffett grant to help women get more control. Poverty erodes health here: Last year, rural Huerfano County, which includes Walsenburg, was ranked second to last for life expectancy in the state.

“If you get pregnant here, you are stuck,” said Debbie Channel, the manager of the Spanish Peaks Regional Health Center’s Outreach and Women’s Clinic, where Ms. Martinez, the nursing home receptionist, got her implant. “We’re trying to keep them safe and baby free.”

Proponents say the program is working. The state health department estimated that every dollar spent on the long-acting birth control initiative saved $5.85 for the state’s Medicaid program, which covers more than three-quarters of teenage pregnancies and births. Enrollment in the federal nutrition program for women with young children declined by nearly a quarter between 2010 and 2013.

Ms. Martinez had a preview of life as a mother while babysitting for two young stepbrothers. She found it exhausting. She watched girls in her high school get trapped when they became mothers too soon, and she knew she did not want that for herself.

“They say they want to leave Walsenburg, but they never do,” she said. “It’s a circle. It keeps happening and happening.”

Ms. Martinez plans to leave town this summer after she marries her fiancé, now in California in military training. She is excited about the next chapter.

“I’m not scared at all,” she said. “I’m just really ready.”

Steve King (R-Iowa) retweeted a British neo-Nazi on Tuesday, the latest in a series of incidents in which the congressman has parroted or promoted the views of unabashed white supremacists and other bigots. Europe is waking up... Will America... in time? King tweeted, linking to an anti-immigrant tweet from political activist Mark Collett. Collett is one of Britains most high-profile white supremacists. He has expressed admiration for Adolf Hitler and has called himself a Nazi sympathizer. Kings office did not respond to multiple requests for comment Tuesday as to whether he condones the views of neo-Nazis, whether hes concerned his views align with those of neo-Nazis or whether a U.S. congressman should be amplifying a neo-Nazi on Twitter. Kings office also did not respond when asked if the congressman considers himself a white nationalist. The tweet, posted early Tuesday morning, hasnt been deleted.

No mainstream politician in their right mind should be retweeting Mark Collett, said Nick Ryan, director of communications at the British-based anti-racism advocacy group Hope Not Hate. Hes a neo-Nazi who used to be the youth leader of the thuggish far-right British National Party here in the U.K., which has had ties to Holocaust denial, rampant anti-Semitism, helped spawn one of Europes most infamous neo-Nazi gangs, Combat 18, and which once included among its number David Copeland, a bomber who targeted Londons minority communities with a series of nail bombs in 1999, killing three, including a pregnant woman, and wounding scores of others, Ryan said. Collett was the subject of a 2002 Channel 4 documentary in the United Kingdom called Young, Nazi and Proud, in which he states that AIDS is a friendly disease because blacks, drug users and gays have it. The Jews have been thrown out of every country, including England, he says in the documentary. Lets face it, when it happens that many times its not just persecution: theres no smoke without fire. More recently, as documented on the blog Angry White Men, Collett has been a frequent guest on white nationalist or alt-right podcasts. Just last month, he co-hosted an episode of This Week on the Alt-Right. The episodes special guest was American white supremacist and former KKK leader David Duke, whom Collett praised. If he has any sense, Steve King should rapidly hit the undo button [on Twitter], Ryan, the Hope Not Hate spokesperson, said of Kings tweet Tuesday. But King has a long history of making racist statements and signaling his support for white nationalism.

HuffPost first asked King whether he considers himself a white nationalist back in December, after he tweeted “Diversity is not our strength,” a phrase used for years by prominent racists and anti-Semites like David Duke. He didn’t respond then either. King has said America should not apologize for slavery, has suggested that the country’s first black president was born in Kenya and has argued that most undocumented immigrants are “drug mules.” “For every [undocumented immigrant] who’s a valedictorian, there’s another 100 out there who weigh 130 pounds — and they’ve got calves the size of cantaloupes because they’re hauling 75 pounds of marijuana across the desert,” he said.  He has also repeatedly expressed admiration for Geert Wilders, the far-right and virulently Islamophobic Dutch politician who has called for banning all mosques and Islamic symbols from the Netherlands. King tweeted a photo of himself standing with Wilders, with the caption: “Cultural suicide by demographic transformation must end.”  And in March 2017, King tweeted, “Wilders understands that culture and demographics are our destiny. We can’t restore our civilization with somebody else’s babies.” "

175,snopes61,0,https://www.activistpost.com/2016/11/sheriffs-dept-fine-people-1k-bringing-food-supplies-standing-rock.html,Sheriff’s Dept to Fine People $1K for Bringing in Food and Supplies to Standing Rock,"In what could only be termed a potential gross violation of human rights, the Morton County Sheriff’s Department announced today it plans to block all supplies from entering Standing Rock camps — including deliveries of food.

Reuters reports: “Supplies, including food and building materials, will be blocked from entering the main camp following Governor Jack Dalrymple’s signing of an ‘emergency evacuation’ order on Monday, said Maxine Herr, a spokeswoman from the Morton County Sheriff’s Department.”

Herr flatly stated, according to Reuters, “They have deliveries, retailers that are delivering to them – we will turn around any of those services.”

Although the governor’s order went into effect immediately, North Dakota Department of Emergency Services spokeswoman Cecily Fong noted no deliveries to the camps had yet been turned away as of Tuesday morning.

However, ‘The building materials intended for the site are a top priority because the camp is not zoned for permanent structures,’ Reuters reported she said. ‘Propane tanks also will be blocked because they have been used in attacks against law enforcement.’

The latter claim has been proven false by eyewitness video from the night of November 20-21, when law enforcement assaulted peaceful water protectors for over six hours in a non-stop barrage of rubber bullets, tear gas, impact and concussion grenades, and even weaponized water — in temperatures dropping into the low 20s Fahrenheit. Sophia Wilansky’s arm was nearly ripped from her body when an impact grenade exploded. But the sheriff denies police used any weapon that could have caused such damage, despite evidence collected from the scene and by surgeons working to repair her traumatic wound.

Shortly after issuing the notice it would block supplies, the Morton County Sheriff’s Department backed away somewhat, saying it would take a passive role to try to prevent supplies from reaching the camps, by issuing hefty $1,000 fines for vehicles attempting such deliveries — saying it had interpreted the evacuation order as a reason for a blockade.

“That is the understanding that we had initially but we had to get that clarified,” Herr told Reuters. “The governor is more interested in public safety than setting up a road block and turning people away.”

This startling announcement of any attempt at a supply blockage from the Morton County Sheriff’s Department comes during a week of shocking news for Standing Rock Sioux water protectors and their allies camped near the Missouri River to block construction of the highly contentious Dakota Access Pipeline.

An eviction notice letter sent by the Army Corps of Engineers to Standing Rock Sioux Tribe Chairman Dave Archambault II and Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe Chairman Harold Frazier on Friday sparked furious outrage from around the world — and was met with firm resistance from both tribes.

Clarifying later that no force would be used to effect this eviction, the Army Corps stated, “Those who remain will be considered unauthorized and may be subject to citation under federal, state, or local laws.”

Before the shock wore off from that letter, on Monday, North Dakota Governor Jack Dalrymple confounded matters further with the issuance of an emergency evacuation order for the same Army Corps-managed, water protector-occupied land as a winter storm advanced on the area.

Although neither U.S. government-issued order would apply had treaties from the 1800s been honored, the attorneys scrambled to determine if the governor’s evacuation supplanted the Army Corps’ eviction — as the date for the camps to become officially illegal would be moved forward significantly from December 5. Archambault denounced Dalrymple’s order as an intimidation tactic and determined it invalid.

However, the Morton County Sheriff’s Department appears to have opportuned the current evacuation order to escalate its curtailment of the basic human rights of the thousands of water protectors estimated to now occupy camps north of the Cannonball River.

Legally and technically speaking, both orders effectively close the camps — except for Sacred Stone Camp, located south of the river — to access by both the public and emergency services.

Thousands of veterans have been planning to arrive at the camps on December 4 to defend water protectors from brutal police tactics employed by the multi-state coalition of police led by the Morton County Sheriff’s Department — and they haven’t yet changed those plans.

According to an update from Reuters, Governor Dalrymple’s spokesman Jeff Zent said, “There is not going to be any blockade of supplies.”

While so much about these breaking developments remains unclear thanks to a lack of information from authorities and officials, one thing is certain. Blocking food and supplies, by any means, from reaching water protectors who have vowed to stay through the winter is not only a violation of human rights and basic decency — if effective, it has the potential to be an horrific tragedy in the making."

177,snopes63,0,https://apnews.com/553ff88b430a4334868105f7a943b912,Congress blocks rule barring mentally impaired from guns,"Congress on Wednesday sent President Donald Trump legislation blocking an Obama-era rule designed to keep guns out of the hands of certain mentally disabled people.
 

 On a vote of 57-43, the Senate backed the resolution, just one of several early steps by the Republican-led Congress to undo regulations implemented by former President Barack Obama. The House had passed the measure earlier this year. The White House has signaled Trump will sign the legislation.
 

 The Obama rule would have prevented an estimated 75,000 people with mental disorders from being able to purchase a firearm. It was crafted as part of Obama's efforts to strengthen the federal background check system in the wake of the 2012 massacre of 20 young students and six staff at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut.
 

 Adam Lanza, a 20-year-old man with a variety of impairments, including Asperger's syndrome and obsessive-compulsive disorder, shot and killed his mother at their home, then went to school where he killed the students, adults and himself. He used his mother's guns in the attack.
 

 The Obama administration rule required the Social Security Administration to send in the names of beneficiaries with mental impairments who also have a third party manage their benefits.
 

 But lawmakers, with the backing of the National Rifle Association and advocacy groups for the disabled, opposed the regulation and encouraged Congress to undertake a rarely successful parliamentary tool designed to void regulations that Congress takes issue with.
 

 With a Republican ally in the White House, the GOP has moved aggressively on several fronts to rescind some of the Obama administration's final regulations on the environment, financial reporting and now guns. Under an expedited process established through the Congressional Review Act, a regulation is made invalid when a simple majority of both chambers pass a joint resolution of disapproval and the president signs it.
 

 The House also voted to repeal three Labor Department regulations Wednesday, including a rule that established when states could require drug testing for certain laid-off workers seeking unemployment insurance. Critics seeking the repeal said the department crafted the regulation so narrowly that it undermined congressional intent to give states more leeway to use drug testing in their unemployment insurance programs.
 

 On the gun rule, Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, spearheaded the repeal effort, saying the regulation unfairly stigmatizes the disabled and infringes on their constitutional right to bear arms. He said that the mental disorders covered through the regulation are filled with ""vague characteristics that do not fit into the federal mentally defective standard"" prohibiting someone from buying or owning a gun.
 

 Grassley cited eating and sleep disorders as examples of illnesses that could allow a beneficiary to be reported to the background check system if they also have a third party to manage their benefits.
 

 Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., said he didn't know how he could explain to his constituents, including those in Newtown, that Congress was making it easier rather than harder for people with serious mental illness to have a gun.
 

 ""If you can't manage your own financial affairs, how can we expect that you're going to be a responsible steward of a dangerous, lethal firearm,"" Murphy said.
 

 Gun rights groups weren't the only organizations upset about the Obama administration's regulation. The American Civil Liberties Union criticized it, too. The ACLU said the rule advanced a harmful stereotype that people with mental disabilities, ""a vast and diverse group of citizens, are violent."" More than a dozen advocacy groups for the disabled also opposed the Obama administration's regulation.
 

 ""This heartless resolution puts the most vulnerable Americans at risk,"" countered Dan Gross, president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence. ""Make no mistake, this vote was really about deepening the gun industry's customer pool, at the expense of those in danger of hurting themselves or others.""
 

 On the labor rule, Mississippi, Wisconsin and Texas are among the states seeking more flexibility in using drug tests in their unemployment insurance programs. Republicans complained that the Obama administration regulation undercut that flexibility and congressional intent.
 

 ""I am pretty certain that the people who I am privileged to represent would be very upset if they thought somebody was receiving unemployment compensation while they were on drugs, because they think that is going to make it pretty hard for that person to ever get back into the workforce, and they want to be able to identify that,"" said Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla.
 

 Democrats argued that Republicans were simply enabling states to intimidate people from seeking unemployment benefits.
 

 ""The legislation that we are debating today has nothing to do with fighting drug abuse,"" said Rep. Richard Neal, D-Mass. ""It's about allowing states to put one more time-consuming, humiliating obstacle in the way of Americans who work hard, and were laid off from their jobs and need unemployment insurance to pay the bills while they look for new jobs."""

 New York's lawsuit will say the firearms industry's selling practices create a public nuisance by allowing guns to be sold in an illegitimate secondary market where they fall into the hands of criminals.

The author's family wants him to stop.,"It's too bad Donald Trump canceled his Chicago rally last week. It would've been something to hear him read the lyrics of ""The Snake"" right here in the hometown of its author, singer-songwriter and social activist Oscar Brown Jr

Trump, for those who haven't been watching his campaign rallies, occasionally takes to reading poetry to his crowds in between his declarations of greatness and calls for violence against his detractors. He really likes to read ""The Snake,"" which tells the story of a charitable woman who takes in an ailing snake only to have the creature turn around and kill her with a venomous bite.

Trump read the song lyrics at his rally Sunday in Bloomington, Ill., just after the part of his campaign speech where he alluded to the threat of Islam and his thoughts on terrorism. The song, he said, prepping his audience, ""represents terrorism.""
 
In Trump's reading, it wraps up with this line:

""'Oh shut up, silly woman,' said the reptile with a grin. 'You knew damn well I was a snake before you took me in.'""

A grin slipped over Trump's face as he looked back up to the audience. ""Right? Does everybody sort of get it?""

The question is: Does Trump?

The song, written by Brown in 1963 and recorded by Al Wilson in 1969, is based on one of Aesop's fables, which means it's been told in various forms for about 2,500 years. It's an allegory, so it can be about a lot of situations where one party unsuspectingly lets in an evildoer and then gets hurt.

It's not clear when or how Trump discovered the R&B song — his campaign hasn't answered my inquiries — or whether he knows anything about Oscar Brown Jr. Trump is more of a classic rock guy, according to Rolling Stone's digging, and especially loves Neil Young. That love soured, though, after Young demanded that Trump stop using his ""Rockin' in the Free World"" on the campaign trail.

Now Brown's family would like Trump to stop using ""The Snake.""

Brown, who died in 2005 at 78, was a singer, songwriter, playwright, actor and social activist. Tribune jazz critic Howard Reich called Brown ""one of the greatest socio-political songwriters of the 20th century."" He wrote such civil rights-era classic as ""Signifyin' Monkey"" and ""Work Song,"" and he brought scenes from the violent streets of Chicago to the stage through his musicals, ""Great Nitty Gritty"" and ""Kicks & Co.""

His family is certain that Brown would be on the ""polar opposite side"" of Trump if he were still alive — and whether the billionaire presidential candidate is violating any copyright or not (lawyers say it's unclear whether Trump could claim ""fair use""), family members say Trump's anti-inclusive message is reason enough to demand that he stop using the song.

""We don't want him using these lyrics,"" said Brown's daughter, Maggie Brown, also a distinguished singer. ""If Dad were alive, he would've ripped (Trump) with a great poem in rebuttal. Not only a poem and a song, but an essay and everything else.""

Maybe Trump was just confused? Perhaps he thought he had something in common with Brown because their families both have history in the real estate business.

It's true: Brown's father, Oscar Brown Sr., like Trump's father, Fred Trump, earned his living in real estate. But that's where the similarity ends.

Oscar Brown Sr., the son of a former slave, a World War I veteran and lawyer, was the first manager of Chicago's Ida B. Wells Homes in 1940 and was a lifelong social activist on behalf of fair housing and equal justice. At one point in the 1930s, disillusioned with the progress of racial integration, he advocated for a new, separate state for African-Americans in the South. In 1944 he served as president of the Chicago chapter of the NAACP.

Meanwhile, Fred Trump and his son, Donald, spent much of the early 1970s in a legal battle with the Department of Justice over allegations that the Trump real estate business in New York violated the Fair Housing Act by discriminating against African-Americans trying to rent apartments.

Wait, who's the snake?

Oscar Brown Jr.'s grandson, Sidakarav Dasa, first noticed Trump's use of ""The Snake"" in January and posted a long objection on his Facebook page. An excerpt:

""I see you liked 'The Snake,' a poem and song written by my revolutionary grandfather, the late, great 'Grandpap of Rap,' Oscar Brown Jr. (who was recently honored by having a street named after him on Chicago's South Side, where he lived). It would have been nice if you credited him for his work, but I can see how telling your crowd that you were quoting a man who resigned from the Communist Party in 1956, declaring himself 'just too black to be red,' might be problematic.""

Dasa went on to recommend that Trump consider reading another Brown poem at his rallies, one called ""Debris"" that addresses the political reaction to the 9/11 attacks and includes this line:

""So efforts to terrorize terror / Just guarantee terror no end / A violent response is in error / For violence then will extend.""

Perhaps Donald Trump has done us an unintentional favor, though, by reminding us of Brown's legacy and bringing ""The Snake"" into this campaign. The lyrics are relevant. There is a snake in our midst, and we should be alarmed.

Does everybody sort of get it?

 He should not be allowed to do so -- not because of any American hostility to the Koran, but because the act undermines American civilization.
 

 First, it is an act of hubris that perfectly exemplifies multiculturalist activism -- my culture trumps America's culture. What Ellison and his Muslim and leftist supporters are saying is that it is of no consequence what America holds as its holiest book; all that matters is what any individual holds to be his holiest book.
 

 Forgive me, but America should not give a hoot what Keith Ellison's favorite book is. Insofar as a member of Congress taking an oath to serve America and uphold its values is concerned, America is interested in only one book, the Bible. If you are incapable of taking an oath on that book, don't serve in Congress. In your personal life, we will fight for your right to prefer any other book. We will even fight for your right to publish cartoons mocking our Bible. But, Mr. Ellison, America, not you, decides on what book its public servants take their oath.
 

 Devotees of multiculturalism and political correctness who do not see how damaging to the fabric of American civilization it is to allow Ellison to choose his own book need only imagine a racist elected to Congress. Would they allow him to choose Hitler's ""Mein Kampf,"" the Nazis' bible, for his oath? And if not, why not? On what grounds will those defending Ellison's right to choose his favorite book deny that same right to a racist who is elected to public office?
 

 So why are we allowing Keith Ellison to do what no other member of Congress has ever done -- choose his own most revered book for his oath?
 

 The answer is obvious -- Ellison is a Muslim. And whoever decides these matters, not to mention virtually every editorial page in America, is not going to offend a Muslim. In fact, many of these people argue it will be a good thing because Muslims around the world will see what an open society America is and how much Americans honor Muslims and the Koran.
 

 But these naive people do not appreciate that America will not change the attitude of a single American-hating Muslim by allowing Ellison to substitute the Koran for the Bible. In fact, the opposite is more likely: Ellison's doing so will embolden Islamic extremists and make new ones, as Islamists, rightly or wrongly, see the first sign of the realization of their greatest goal -- the Islamicization of America.
 

 When all elected officials take their oaths of office with their hands on the very same book, they all affirm that some unifying value system underlies American civilization. If Keith Ellison is allowed to change that, he will be doing more damage to the unity of America and to the value system that has formed this country than the terrorists of 9-11. It is hard to believe that this is the legacy most Muslim Americans want to bequeath to America. But if it is, it is not only Europe that is in trouble."

 Nyes been named the events honorary co-chair, which means according to him he can go to Starbucks with the title and get a coffee for five dollars. In other words it doesnt change his regular joe status.
 

 But the thing is, Nye is no regular joe.

 Nye is the only entertainment personality with the movements distinction, although he also holds a degree in mechanical engineering. Others include Mona Hanna-Attisha, the doctor who helped expose lead poisoning in Flint, and Lydia Villa-Komaroff, a molecular biologist who helped develop the technique for making insulin. (The March for Science is a reaction from the scientific community over the Trump administrations handling of science issues, especially when it comes to climate change.)
 

 Bill is arguably best known for hosting the popular childrens show Bill Nye the Science Guy in the mid-1990s, but his history since then has made him a headliner in the climate change conversation. He has been a part of a few tense debates concerning the realities of climate change, and hes only going to talk about it more on his new show, much to the chagrin of people who may not want to hear it.
 

 Im trying to change the world, he told TheWrap in a recent interview. You may be tired of people like me talking about climate change. Were tired, too! he said. Its the most important problem facing humankind, in my opinion.

 Nye has grown far beyond the confines of his childrens show host persona. He still wears the bowties and puts on a cheery, enthusiastic exterior (he uses phrases like sunshine team in our interview), but like a lot of his original audience, his priorities lie in different areas, specifically in debunking pseudo-science. Hes taken on climate change deniers on talk shows and has been vocal in the fight for legitimizing science. This has made him some enemies, such as Fox News host Tucker Carlson, who he says is probably anti-Bill.
 

 Bill Nye Saves the World seeks to help its audience tackle scientific issues with a critical eye. With the help of guest stars such as Zach Braff, Karlie Kloss, Tim Gunn and others, Nye and his correspondents, as he calls them, go around the world exploring topics such as alternative medicine and climate change things that have scores of believers but no basis in science.
 

 In one episode, Nye and his team address the spiritual practice of walking on burning hot coals. While people pay for retreats to learn how to do this, Nye proves that its possible mostly with physics.
 

 People will charge you $5,000 for a weekend where you learn to be spiritually prepared to walk across wooden burning coals. You dont have to do that, you can just walk across wooden burning coals, he exclaimed.

 In another, he highlights alternative medicine practices, seeking to educate people on the realities of the industry in a literal sense. These methods of healing may have mental effects but for Nye, theres no basis in science.
 

 If you go to a foo-foo grocery store where the food is whole, for example, most of their money is made off these alternative medicines or dietary supplements, and most of them dont do anything, he said. I think people will be interested to watch it.
 

 While hes interested in how things look now, hes also looking to the future. In the interview, he mentions his fascination with self-driving cars and artificial intelligence, predicting that by April 2034, driving a car will be a skill like horseback riding: only a select number of people will know how to do it.
 

 My grandfather apparently rode horses to run into World War I, Nye said. Now, nobody rides horses. Everything changed in just 20 years.
 

 Through his work both on the show and off, Nye seeks to teach people how to think critically. He realizes that people have a cognitive dissonance in regards to certain issues like climate change understandable to him considering how isolated certain parts of the United States are and how belief systems work, he says but he hopes that people can learn to use reason.

182,snopes68,0,https://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/local/house-tax-bill-eliminates-wildfire-tax-deduction-as-california-blazes-rage/2032691/,GOP's Tax Bill Could Eliminate Wildfire Tax Deduction as California Blazes Rage,"With wildfires destroying hundreds of homes as they rampage across Southern California this week, Democrats are again chastising Republicans for eliminating a natural disaster deduction from the tax reform bill that the House passed last month.

The House bill, approved on Nov. 16, removes the deduction for personal losses from wildfires, earthquakes, hurricanes and other natural disasters not covered by insurance or other assistance. Victims of major disasters could still get tax breaks provided Congress passes special legislation particular to the disaster.Several fires have been raging in the greater Los Angeles area down to San Diego, threatening lives, homes and businesses. They are being driven by dry conditions and the Santa Ana winds, forcing 190,000 to evacuate, shutting down highways and suspending Amtrak service. Overall, the state has faced one of its most destructive and deadly fire seasons in history.

“The situation is unpredictable and stressful, and safety is the foremost concern,” said Democratic Rep. Grace Napolitano of Norwalk. “It is unreasonable to think those suffering losses from these natural disasters might not be compensated should the Republican tax bill become law. This is absolutely heartless and must be fixed.”

The new fires are blazing just as insurance claims from the state’s wine country fires in the fall reached more than $9 billion, the bulk of it from hard-hit Santa Rosa, making those fires the costliest in California’s history. Forty-four people died and thousands of homes were destroyed.

The mayor of Santa Rosa, Chris Coursey, called the elimination of the natural disaster deduction “unfathomably bad.” Santa Rosa continues to deal with the state’s worst fire disaster, he said.

“We’ve got a serious humanitarian disaster, a serious infrastructure disaster, a serious economic disaster that we’re facing over the next several years,” Coursey said.

Earlier, the state’s two Democratic senators, Dianne Feinstein and Kamala Harris, noted in a statement that the elimination of the tax deductions in the House bill — among many to make up for cuts in corporate rates and other changes — comes during the worst fire season in the state’s history.

“Asking victims of wildfires or earthquakes to suffer in order to pay for tax cuts for the rich is the height of cruelty,” they said.

Democrats questioned whether residents would to be able to determine their losses in time for this year’s taxes, though they would be able to file for an extension or file an amended return. And Democrats were crying foul over tax benefits that victims of hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria received but not those trying to rebuild from the recent wildfires.

“Our tax code shouldn’t pick winners and losers in natural disasters,” Feinstein and Harris said. “This is just another example of the extraordinary lengths Republicans will go to cut taxes for wealthy corporations and individuals at the expense of middle-class families.”

Coursey criticized Republicans for singling out California, a blue state unlike Florida, Texas and other states hard hit by the hurricanes.

“I don’t know how anyone in Congress can justify taking on the victims of a disaster at a time like this,” he said.

Texas Rep. Kevin Brady, the Republican chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, has said that he plans to introduce legislation offering special tax relief for wildfire victims, too.

“I am focused on securing funding for those impacted by this year’s devastating storms and wildfires while also working to wrap up the most transformational tax reform bill in a generation,” he said in a statement on Thursday.

Current law allows deductions for uncovered losses if the amount exceeds 10 percent of one’s income.

Congress earlier this year waived the 10 percent requirement for the hurricane victims and allowed them to withdraw money from their 401K retirement funds without penalty, among other benefits.

The Senate tax reform bill retains a deduction but only for federally declared natural disasters.

President Donald Trump on Friday declared a state of emergency over the fires, which allows for federal money to fight the fires. That is separate from a major disaster declaration, which would required under the proposed Senate bill and which would provide assistance for emergency and permanent recovery work.

Because wildfires often are smaller than other natural disasters and do not receive a federal designation, the elimination of the deduction would hurt California in particular. Feinstein's office points out that of the 57,981 wildfires in the United States this year, only the October fires in California have received a federal disaster declaration so far, according to data from the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the National Interagency Fire Center.

But the other fires are just as devastating to those affected, lawmakers noted.

“Republicans have said that Americans should not be concerned about this change because if there is a major disaster, then Congress might pass a special bill to provide tax breaks,” Democratic Rep. Brad Sherman, of Sherman Oaks, said. “If your home burns down without it being part of a major disaster – Congress won’t act.  And if there is a major disaster – Congress might not act.”

Americans deducted $1.6 billion in 2015 for natural disaster losses, according to the IRS. The Treasury Department estimated that taxpayers would deduct $4.83 billion in losses beginning next year through 2027.

“LA County has over 11 million residents, and we have recently experienced the worst years of wildfires in our history,” Napolitano said. “My district includes the Foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains, where three major fires over the past eight years have displaced residents, destroyed properties, and disrupted life in our communities. Financial relief has been vital for the recovery efforts of my constituents and the millions who have suffered from natural disasters nationwide.” 

The House and Senate must reconcile their two tax bills before a final version is sent to President Donald Trump. Republicans have said they want a bill by the end of the year."
183,snopes69,0,https://www.forbes.com/sites/trevornace/2017/01/21/welcome-rainbow-mountains-peru/#6f70cdc86f70,Welcome To The Incredible Rainbow Mountains Of Peru,"The miracle is not to walk on water. The miracle is to walk on the green earth, dwelling deeply in the present moment and feeling truly alive. - Thich Nhat Hanh
 

 One of the most magnificent geologic features in the world is the Ausangate Mountain of the Peruvian Andes. The mountain is striped with colors ranging from turquoise to lavender to maroon and gold. However, this ""painted mountain"" is notoriously difficult to find and get to, requiring several days of hiking to reach its peak deep within the Andes by way of Cusco.
 

 The painted Ausangate mountain is also considered to be holy and believed to be the deity of Cusco by local Peruvians. It is a site of daily worship and offerings by local citizens. Every year thousands of Quechua pilgrims visit the Ausangate Mountain for the Star Snow festival which takes place a week before the Corpus Christi feast.
 

 The mountain sits at an elevation of 6,384 meters and is located approximately 100 km southeast of the major city Cusco. The local area is rich in geology, from uplifted granitic cliffs to glaciers which have eroded large valleys and the cretaceous limestone ""forest"" nearby.
 

 The Andes are an incredibly complex mountain chain that extends along the western edge of the South American continent. The subduction of the Nazca plate underneath the South American plate initiated mountain building and uplift of the mountain range. This produced significant volcanism and the introduction of rare and varied mineralogy to the Andes Mountains.
 

 The reason we see the rainbow coloration in the stratigraphic layers of the Ausangate mountain is largely due to weathering and mineralogy. Red coloration of sedimentary layers often indicates iron oxide rust as a trace mineral. Similar to how a nail will rust and turn red when oxidized, sediments that are iron rich will change when exposed to oxygen and water. This, in combination with uplift and tectonically driven crustal shortening has tilted the sedimentary layers on their side exposing stripped stratigraphic intervals.
 

 The different coloration is due to different environmental conditions and mineralogy when the sediment was originally deposited and subsequently diagenetically altered. Introduction of goethite or oxidized limonite will introduce a brownish coloration to sandstones. The bright yellow coloration could be due to iron sulphide as trace minerals within the pore cement. In addition, chlorite will often color sediments varying shades of green dependent on diagenetic history and concentration.
 

 As your eye scans the many layers of the Peruvian Painted Mountain you're seeing millions of years of history and all the complexities that are associated therein. Understanding the environmental and geologic conditions that formed the rock units we see today is one of the key building blocks of geology and allow us to better understand our world long before humans walked this green Earth."
184,snopes7,0,http://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/politics-government/article68401147.html,Understanding HB2: North Carolinas newest law solidifies states role in defining discrimination | Charlotte Observer,"Update: On March 30, 2017, the N.C. General Assembly approved a compromise bill that repealed House Bill 2 but restricts anti-discrimination ordinances in cities and counties. Gov. Roy Cooper signed the measure into law. The story below follows HB2 from its passage.

In a one-day specially convened session on March 23, 2016 North Carolinas legislature passed a sweeping law that reverses a Charlotte ordinance that had extended some rights to people who are gay or transgender.

The law passed by the General Assembly and signed that same night by Gov. Pat McCrory goes further than a narrow elimination of Charlottes ordinance, which had generated the most controversy by a change that protected transgender people who use public restrooms based on their gender identity. The new law also nullified local ordinances around the state that would have expanded protections for the LGBT community.

The state has long had laws regulating workplace discrimination, use of public accommodations, minimum wage standards and other business issues. The new law  known as HB2, the Charlotte bathroom bill or, more officially, as the Public Facilities Privacy and Security Act  makes it illegal for cities to expand upon those state laws, as more than a dozen cities had done, including Charlotte, Raleigh, Chapel Hill and Durham.

North Carolinas new law sets a statewide definition of classes of people who are protected against discrimination: race, religion, color, national origin, age, handicap or biological sex as designated on a persons birth certificate. Sexual orientation  people who are gay  was never explicitly protected under state law and is not now, despite recent court decisions that legalized same-sex marriage.

Transgender people who have not taken surgical and legal steps to change the gender noted on their birth certificates have no legal right under state law to use public restrooms of the gender with which they identify. Cities and counties no longer can establish a different standard. Critics of the Charlotte ordinance cite privacy concerns and say it was social engineering to allow people born as biological males to enter womens restrooms.

McCrorys office says businesses arent limited by the bill, and that private companies and private universities can adopt new or keep existing nondiscrimination policies. Private businesses can establish their own practices concerning LGBT employees and customers.

The pushback has been intense. On July 21, the National Basketball Association announced it will move its All-Star Game from Charlotte in 2017, which will cost the city an estimated $100 million. That decision follows cancellations of business expansions and entertainment events by companies and performers protesting HB2.

In September, the reprisals against the state have intensified. On Sept. 12, the NCAA removed seven championships scheduled to be held in North Carolina during the 2016-17 academic year, including two rounds on the wildly popular mens basketball tournament -- all because of HB2.

Forty-eight hours later the Atlantic Coast Conference followed suit. It announced it was moving the conferences football championship game in December from Charlotte, again in protest to the law.

HB2 supporters from McCrory on down dug in, setting the stage for November elections in which the law was expected to play a potentially decisive role, even as the courts continue the process of deciding whether HB2 discriminates. McCrory lost his bid for reelection to Attorney General Roy Cooper. Observers of all political stripes agreed that the governor's support of HB2 probably cost him the election.

On Dec. 19, 2016, following a surprise move by the Charlotte City Council, Republican Gov. Pat McCrory Monday called for a special session Wednesday, Dec. 21 to consider repeal of House Bill 2.

McCrorys call came hours after the Charlotte City Council voted 10-0 with Mayor Jennifer Roberts support to rescind the LGBT ordinance that prompted HB 2.

On Dec. 21, the N.C. Senate voted down a repeal of HB2 after a day of increasingly partisan rancor that pitted conservative Republicans against the Charlotte they so distrust. The state House adjourned without voting on repeal of the bill that has cost North Carolina millions of dollars in lost jobs, sports events and boycotts. With that, the hope of compromise between legislators and Charlotte, which enacted the ordinance that gave rise to HB2, dissolved.

Here are additional questions and answers about the new law:

Does HB2 affect rights of people who arent gay or transgender?

Yes. The law changes the way people pursue claims of discrimination because of race, religion, color, national origin, biological sex or handicap in state courts. While the legislature amended HB2 to restore the rights of residents to sue on these grounds in state courts, it shortened the window for filing complaints from three years to one.

The law also means a city or county cannot set a minimum wage standard for private employers.

Are other states taking the same approach?

Yes. Some states and local governments are considering or even passed new laws aimed at blocking specific LGBT rights. The national headquarters of the ACLU describes North Carolinas HB2 as the most extreme anti-LGBT measure in the country. Some legal experts say the N.C. bill combines elements of laws in other states that make it more comprehensive. South Dakotas legislature passed a bill focused specifically on public schools; that bill was vetoed by the governor, the ACLU said. States that recently have proposed similar measures include Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky and West Virginia, experts say.

None has the sweep of HB2, UNC Chapel Hill law professor Maxine Eichner said in May. ""Nobody has passed a law like this.""

How big a court fight will this be?

At least five lawsuits have been filed against or in support of the law. On one side: The ACLU, Equality North Carolina and other groups sued within days of HB2 becoming law. The U.S. Justice Department followed on May 9 after first warning the state that the law jeopardizes billions of federal dollars the state receives each year in money for schools, colleges and other issues.

Also in early May, McCrory and Republican legislative leaders Phil Berger and Tim Moore filed their own complaints, accusing the federal government of distorting discrimination law to include LGBT protections and asking the federal courts to deem HB2 nondiscriminatory.

The cases have been filed in two separate federal courts and have been assigned to three different judges.

The ACLU and the U.S. Justice Department has asked a judge to suspend HB2 while its lawsuit is being decided, arguing that damage is done to the LGBT community every day the law is in place.

On Aug. 26, 2016, U.S. District Judge Thomas Schroeder gave the HB2 critics a partial victory when he banned the University of North Carolina from enforcing HB2 against the transgender plaintiffs in the lawsuit pending his ruling in the trial.

Federal documents indicate the trial on the ACLU's lawsuit could take place as early as October or November. It would not be unreasonable to expect Schroeder's ruling by the summer of 2017, perhaps before. The losing side would almost certainly appeal to a higher court.

Meanwhile, 21 states have joined North Carolina in opposing the federal mandate that transgender individuals be allowed to use the public bathrooms that matches their sexual identity or lose federal money.

On Aug. 22, 2016, a federal judge in Texas issued a nationwide order blocking the Obama administration order that would give transgender students in public schools access to bathrooms and locker rooms matching their gender identity.

The ruling by U.S. District Judge Reed OConnor, who is hearing the lawsuit by the 21 states, dealt a setback to the governments argument that Title IX anti-discrimination protections apply to transgender students. It also moves the battle over transgender rights one procedural step closer to a showdown in the Supreme Court.

What federal protections exist for workplace discrimination for LGBT employees?

There is no federal law that specifically prohibits discrimination against LGBT citizens in their jobs. The Employment Nondiscrimination Act that would do so has been proposed for many years, but has not passed.

Can someone be fired in North Carolina for being gay or transgender?

Yes. North Carolina is an at will employment state and offers limited protection for all workers. State law has never included protections for workers who are LGBT. The language in HB2 makes it more clear that the state does not intend to create a new class of protections based on sexual orientation or identity, and also will not allow cities and counties to create such a protected class.

How does HB2 affect schools?

Under HB2, North Carolina now requires students to use public school restrooms and locker rooms based on the gender on their birth certificates. The federal government says that violates Title IX of the Civil Rights Act that prohibits discrimination in all school programs. The federal government includes sexual identity and orientation under the broader category of sex discrimination.

McCrory and other HB2 supporters accuse the Justice Department, the U.S. Department of Education and other federal officials of ""radically reinterpreting"" discrimination law to include LGBT individuals. The 4th Circuit Court of Appeals, which has precedence in North Carolina, ruled in a recent Virginia transgender bathroom case that the federal agencies acted within their rights to include LGBT protections.

That leaves the state's public colleges, universities and local school districts caught in the middle of a bitter court fight, with potentially billions of federal education dollars at stake.

North Carolina's school superintendent said in May that school districts across the state were not complying with HB2. That appeared to be the case in Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools, the state's second largest district. The Rowan-Salisbury schools did say it would follow state law while respecting the privacy of all of its students.

The University of North Carolina System announced in May it will not enforce HB2.

Where is public opinion in North Carolina on LGBT rights?

In 2012, a constitutional ban on same-sex marriage passed with more than 60 percent of the vote. A June 2015 poll from the Democrat-leading Public Policy Polling of Raleigh showed that 44 percent of state residents supported same-sex marriage, with 46 percent opposed. Last April, an Elon University poll found that 63 percent of the states registered voters disagreed with the states magistrate law. The same poll showed that 51 percent of Republicans supported a business right to deny service to customers based on religious objections.

On HB2, an Elon poll in late April showed that 49 percent of state residents polled supported the bathroom provisions of the law.

What are some of the political factors driving this?

Conservative religious groups within North Carolina are taking some credit for getting HB2 passed into law, and pro-LGBT rights advocates note there is financial support from national groups with similar interests. Many also believe gay and transgender issues are being used by politicians to motivate voters in a presidential and gubernatorial election year. In North Carolina, both Republicans and Democrats are using HB2 as a rallying point for supporters, with each side believing that the law can win them votes.

Nowhere are the battle lines more clearly drawn than in the governor's race between McCrory, an HB2 defender, and Attorney General Roy Cooper, a Democrat who believes the law should be repealed.

Predictably, both came out on different sides on the NBA decision to move the All-Star game, using powerful statements to attack each other.

Southern Evangelical Seminary president Richard Land says the situation may indicate a growing anger in the country on both the left and right. I dont like the form the revolution is taking, he said. Donald Trump is coarse and crude and frankly, dangerous, but I understand what is behind it. ...The establishment in Washington shows signs of existing more for its own benefit than for the people they were elected to serve.

How did Democrats vote on HB2?

The vote in the N.C. House was 84-25 after three hours of debate, with all Republicans voting for it and 11 Democrats breaking ranks with their party to support the bill. In the Senate, the vote was 32-0 after the Democrats walked out in protest, saying they had not been allowed to participate in the process. McCrory, a Republican, then signed it into law.

Could this hurt economic development and tourism in North Carolina?

It already has. The loss of the sporting events will cost the economy millions, a loss that will trickle down through the hotel and restaurant sectors.

After the law passed, PayPal canceled a much-ballyhooed expansion in Charlotte that would have included 400 jobs.

In the Triangle, Braeburn Pharmaceuticals said it was reconsidering a research and manufacturing facility in Durham that included 52 jobs and a $20 million investment.

Now the NBA decision eliminates an estimated $100 million windfall for the Charlotte area.

Major employers in North Carolina  American Airlines, Lowes, Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, to name a few  all have said theyre disappointed with the measure, though they havent threatened to pull out from the state.

On the entertainment front, headline acts from Bruce Springsteen to Itzhak Perlman and Pearl Jam have canceled shows in Charlotte, Greensboro and other N.C. venues. On Friday, May 20, Maroon 5 joined the list.

On tourism and economic-development fronts, some business leaders say the new law is feeding a perception that North Carolina isnt inclusive.

The British government went so far as to issue a travel advisory to its LGBT citizens who planned to travel to the state.

The N.C. Justice Center says that if federal money for education, job training and public safety is withheld -- which most believe is unlikely -- the state could lose 53,000 jobs or $2.4 billion in wages. Conservatives say those numbers are wildly high and being used as a scare tactic.

If boycotts happen, do they work?

South Carolina was the subject of many boycotts for flying the Confederate flag at the state capitol. The NAACP announced a national boycott of the state in 2000. Tourism officials estimated the state lost $7 million in the first month as groups from the NCAA to the American Bar Association joined the protest. The loss of sporting events alone cost Columbia, Charleston and Greenville-Spartanburg millions of dollars every year, reports say. The flag was removed last year not because of boycotts, but after the mass killings at a Charleston church that appear to have been racially motivated.

Havent cities other than Charlotte expanded nondiscrimination ordinances?

Charlottes ordinance was the first of its kind in North Carolina. Three South Carolina cities have similar ordinances: Columbia, Charleston and Myrtle Beach. Theyre written differently, but conceptually are identical to what Charlotte did, city attorney Bob Hagemann has said. Those South Carolina cities and more than 200 other cities around the nation where similar ordinances exist have not reported problems with transgender bathroom use.

Amazon recently pulled a number of high-profile hoverboard brands from its online store following reports of the electric scooters bursting into flames. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (USCPSC) is looking into at least 10 reports of the devices overheating and causing fires, according to numerous reports like this one from NBC News.
 

 The USCPSC isnt naming names, so its unclear which brands are to blame for the issue. The general belief is that cheaper models, especially no-name brands from China, are the problem. Bigger (and more expensive) names may be a safer bet.
 

 Amazon isnt taking any chances, however, and is only selling a select number of hoverboards at this writing, including brands such as Hover X, Jetson, and Sharper Image. The rest are being asked to provide documentation proving their products comply with various safety standards for batteries and chargers, hoverboard maker Swagway recently told The Verge.
 

 Airlines are also getting into the anti-hoverboard action. Alaskan, American, British Airways, Delta, Hawaiian, Jet Blue, Spirit, United, and Virgin America are all forbidding hoverboards on their aircraft. The ban includes carry-on and checked luggage. A family in Louisiana also blamed a house fire on a new hoverboard.
 

 Delta recently said in a statement it believes the lithium-ion batteries powering the hoveboards are to blame. The airline said manufacturers are inconsistent when it comes to proper labeling for the size and power of the batteries. Delta also said many hoverboards have batteries that exceed the 160 watt hour size, which is the maximum allowed onboard a plane.
 

 The impact on you at home: If you were thinking about snagging a hoverboard as a gift this season it might be wise to make other plans. Product review sites like Best Reviews and the Wirecutter are advising people not to buy these devices until the safety concerns are cleared up. Until then, a good ol skateboard is probably be a better choice just remember to get a helmet too."

 The Canadian Elementary Teachers Federation (ETFO) of Ontario hosted a LGGBDTTTIQQAAPP inclusiveness training session on June 6.
 

 The acronym stands for Lesbian, Gay, Genderqueer, Bisexual, Demisexual, Transgender, Transsexual, Twospirit, Intersex, Queer, Questioning, Asexual, Allies, Pansexual and Polyamorous.
 

 The Canadian Elementary Teachers Federation of Ontario hosted a LGGBDTTTIQQAAPP inclusiveness training on June 6
 

 Conducted for the Durham ETFO Executive, Stewards and other interested folks, the session included a presentation from Dr Barb Perry of UOIT & Durham PFLAG.
 

 While inclusivity is generally applauded, some on social media were more than a little baffled by the title. And it attracted plenty of hate from the Right.
 

 One user wrote: 'ETFO is learning about the LGGBDTTTIQQAAPP. I wonder if they feel insignificant or perhaps inadequate with their piddly little acronym?'
 

 Another said: 'LGGBDTTTIQQAAPP just rolls off the tongue.'
 

 While terms like Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Allies, Transgender, Transexual and Questioning may be familiar to the common person, others may seem confusing to those that aren't used to the terms.
 

 A person who identifies as Genderqueer or Nonbinary does not feel like terms such as 'male' or 'female' adequately designate how they identify or choose to present themselves.
 

 Aexuality.org defines a Demisexual as someone who does not experience sexual attraction unless they form a strong emotional connection with someone.
 

 Accounting for Native Peoples, the training also is inclusive of those who identify as Two-Spirit or those who possess both masculine and feminine spirits.
 

 Conducted for the Durham ETFO Executive, stewards and other folks, the session included a presentation from Dr Barb Perry of UOIT & Durham PFLAG. School children are taught inclusiveness in elementary school (pictured) (stock)
 

 Someone who is intersex has been born in the middle of the spectrum for both male and female. An intersex person may be born with genital ambiguity.
 

 Asexuality accounts for those who do not feel any sexual feeling or desire at all.
 

 Pansexual is the open sexuality of another person no matter their sex or gender identify.
 

 And someone who is Polyamorous seeks intimate relationships with more than one partner.
 

 'There are other terms you can use to explain your ""unique"" situation: you could go back to using #LGBT/#LGBTQ instead of #LGGBDTTTIQQAAPP (silent F?): #nonstraight, #colorfulsnowflake, etc. All I know is that this new acronym is totally killing the purpose of one,' said one user
 

 Another user pointed out how many iterations of the acronym they had heard
 

 The sessions goal was 'to become more familiar with current language, sensitive to current issues, and to share best practices in supporting our LGGBDITTTIQQAAPP peers and students.'
 

 According to the flier, fewer than one per cent of ETFO members were open with their identities, even though half of the public 'secretly identities as LGBT to some extent.
 

 'If we want students to succeed, if we want to educe staff anxiety and stress, we need to create a much more welcoming and accepting environment,' the flier added."

 Oh no, no honey,"" Richard said of her reply. ""You guys are misunderstanding again. Thats not how it is.""
 

 However, after speaking to her daughters teacher, she realized the statement was accurate.
 

 The teacher said she cant. She has to say yes. She has to accept and I said, 'Excuse me, Richard tells Fox 13.
 

 Richard took her concerns to the school principal.
 

 He basically just said theyve had this dance set up this way for a long time and theyve never had any concern before, she said of his response.
 

 Lane Findlay with the Weber School District confirms its a rule, but he said its meant to teach students how to be inclusive.
 

 Please be respectful, be polite,"" Findlay said. ""We want to promote kindness, and so we want you to say yes when someone asks you to dance.""
 

 I do see it from their perspective when it comes to that, but there are many other ways to teach children how to be accepting than with a social dance, Richard counters.
 

 Richard says forcing students not to say no teaches them the wrong lesson.
 

 Sends a bad message to girls that girls have to say 'yes'; sends a bad message to boys that girls cant say 'no,'"" Richard said.
 

 Prior to the dance, which is voluntary, students are told to fill out a card by selecting five people they want to dance with. The administration says if theres someone on the card you feel uncomfortable with, the student is encouraged to speak up.
 

 If there is an issue, if theres students that are uncomfortable or have a problem with another student, I mean: thats certainly something that can be addressed with that student and parents, Findlay said.
 

 However, Richard says rejection is part of life and at the end of the day, this policy is sending impressionable children the wrong message.
 

 Psychologically, my daughter keeps coming to me and saying I cant say 'no' to a boy,"" she said. ""Thats the message kids are getting.""
 

 One of the concerns that Richard addressed with the principal at Kanesville Elementary is that parents werent aware of this policy. She recommended he send out a permission slip, detailing the instructions given to students, and he agreed. As of now, the rule remains in place."
189,snopes74,0,http://archive.is/3lbJD,Catholic school removes Jesus statues to be 'more inclusive',"Art Moore, co-author of the best-selling book ""See Something, Say Nothing,"" entered the media world as a PR assistant for the Seattle Mariners and a correspondent covering pro and college sports for Associated Press Radio. He reported for a Chicago-area daily newspaper and was senior news writer for Christianity Today magazine and an editor for Worldwide Newsroom before joining WND shortly after 9/11. He earned a master's degree in communications from Wheaton College.
 

 Parents of students at a Catholic school in the San Francisco Bay area are protesting the boards decision to remove and relocate more than 160 statues of Jesus, Mary and historic church figures from the campus in an effort to make the school more inclusive.
 

 Shannon Fitzpatrick, who has an 8-year-old son at San Domenico School in San Anselmo told the local Marin Independent Journal that articulating an inclusive foundation appears to mean letting go of San Domenicos 167-year tradition as a Dominican Catholic school and being both afraid and ashamed to celebrate ones heritage and beliefs.
 

 She said that during the time of her familys association with the K-12 independent school, the word Catholic has been removed from the mission statement, sacraments were removed from the curriculum, the lower school curriculum was changed to world religions, the logo and colors were changed to be less Catholic, and the uniform was changed to be less Catholic.
 

 The chair of the schools board of trustees, Amy Skewes-Cox, explained to the local paper that the move was made to help non-Christian students feel more welcome.
 

 If you walk on the campus and the first thing you confront is three or four statues of St. Dominic or St. Francis, it could be alienating for that other religion, and we didnt want to further that feeling, she said.
 

 The removal of a statue of Mary and the Christ child from the schools center courtyard was especially troubling to parents.
 

 Fitzpatrick said other families share her concern.
 

 Many parents feel if the school is heading in a different direction then the San Domenico community should have been notified before the signing of the enrollment for the following year, she said.
 

 Another parent, Cheryl Newell, told the Independent Journal the school is trying to be something for everyone, and theyre making no one happy.
 

 Skewes-Cox told the Marin County paper the relocation and removal of some of the schools 180 religious statues was completely in compliance with a new strategic plan approved unanimously last year by the board and the Dominican Sisters of San Rafael.
 

 She said at least 18 remain, including a statue of St. Dominic at the center of the campus.
 

 The trustees director insisted that while the removal coincides with the removal of Confederate statues across the United States, the issues are totally different and have absolutely no connection other than it is change, and people have a hard time with change.
 

 In 2006, WND reported a cross in the chapel at the College of William & Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia, was removed to make the chapel a faith-specific space, and to make it more welcoming to students, faculty, staff and visitors of all faiths.
 

 San Domenico, founded by the Dominican Sisters in 1850 as an independent, Catholic school, meaning its not owned by a religious order, has 660 students, including 98 from foreign nations. Among the religions they represent are Judaism, Buddhism, Hinduism and Islam.
 

 Instead of teaching Catholic theology, the school provides instruction in world religions and philosophy.
 

 The head of the school, Cecily Stock, told the Independent Journal the schools approach is really about empowering each student and giving them the information so they can discover their own purpose, their own truth.
 

 Mirza Khan, the schools director of philosophy, ethics and world religions, told the paper the Dominican teaching philosophy is not to teach there is only one truth.
 

 It is to foster conversation, to intentionally invite in participants that have different perspectives in a very open-ended process of philosophical and spiritual inquiry. That has been a long-standing part of the Dominican tradition."
190,snopes75,0,http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/donald-trumps-nuclear-uncle,Donald Trumps Nuclear Uncle,"In September, 1936, a reporter for the Associated Press watched the unveiling of a new kind of X-ray machine, said to be able to generate a million volts of power. The scientist operating the device was John G. Trump, a professor of engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Trump was working the controls and explaining how high-speed electrons ran along a porcelain tube to a water-cooled gold target, when suddenly two of the high-voltage sparks hit him squarely on the nose. And yet, according to the A.P. account, the direct strike caused him only slight discomfort. Professor Trump told the reporter, Thats an advantage of this machine. Its completely grounded and those sparks cant kill you.
 

 If only the same could be said of the Presidential campaign run by Professor Trumps nephew, Donald J. Trump. He is still uncomfortably close to victory, which is why there have been, lately, more serious attempts to figure out what he might do if, say, he had access to nuclear weapons. In his answers, he seldom sounds as ungrounded as when he invokes Professor Trump, the younger brother of his father, Fred. My uncle used to tell me about nuclear before nuclear was nuclear, Trump said in one interview, before nuclear referring, perhaps, to the development of hydrogen bombs, rather than basic atomic bombs (which occurred when Donald was about six years old), or perhaps just to that netherworld where things wait until Trump judges them to be fashionable or flashy enough to exist. He mentions his uncle so often, and in such extravagant termsbrilliant, one of the top, top professors at M.I.T.that it seems worth asking what the professor and his arcane knowledge mean to him. There are two different sets of answers, which might be put into the category of foreign and domestic.
 

 But first, given Trumps tendency to wrap things in porcelain and gold and shoot sparks through them, its worth noting that John Trump really does seem to have been a brilliant scientist. He was at M.I.T. for decades, and the X-ray machines he helped design provided additional years of life to cancer patients throughout the world, as the Times put it in his obituary, in 1985. Trump was involved in radar research for the Allies in the Second World War, and in 1943 the F.B.I. had enough faith in his technical ability and his discretion to call him in when Nikola Tesla died in his room at the New Yorker Hotel, in Manhattan, raising the question of whether enemy agents might have had a chance to learn some of his secrets before the body was found. (One fear was that Tesla was working on a death ray.) As Margaret Cheney and Robert Uth recount in Tesla, Master of Lightning, Professor Trump examined Teslas papers and equipment, and, in a written report, told the F.B.I. not to worry: Teslas thoughts and efforts during at least the past 15 years were primarily of a speculative, philosophical, and somewhat promotional character, but did not include new, sound, workable principles or methods for realizing such results. Professor Trump may have neglected to make that sort of distinction clear to his nephew.
 

 What is strange is that Donald Trump couples tales of how he received early, secret word from his uncle that nuclear weapons were dangerous and getting more soHe would tell me, There are things that are happening that could be potentially so bad for the world in terms of weaponry, he told the Boston Globewith a casual indifference about proliferation. In recent interviews, Trump has said that if countries like Japan and South Korea didnt want to pay America more for military protection, they should go and build their own nuclear weapons. When, in one seesawing exchange, Anderson Cooper asked if this meant he was for proliferation, Trump first disagreed, citingnaturallythe professor. I hate nuclear more than any. My uncle was a professor was at M.I.T., used to tell me about nuclear, Trump said. But then he added, Can I be honest with you? Its going to happen, anyway. Its going to happen anyway. Its only a question of time . . . Now, wouldnt you rather in a certain sense have Japan have nuclear weapons when North Korea has nuclear weapons? (Actually, no.)
 

 Its true that nuclear weapons are not that hard for a determined country to acquire, which is why the best counter-proliferation tool is diplomacythat is, deal-making, which Trump prides himself on and yet, in this case, tosses aside. Last week, President Obama attended an international summit on nuclear weapons, in Washington, and said in a press conference that the representatives of other countries had told him they were worried about Trump, who, Obama said, doesnt know much about foreign policy or nuclear policy or the Korean Peninsula or the world generally.
 

 It gets stranger still when Trump invokes the bomb as a way to dismiss talk of climate change: The only global warming Im worried about is nuclear global warming. Was he thinking of the nuclear winter, but got it backward? Or of the heat generated when bombs, which his uncle told him would be nuclear even before there was nuclear, detonate? It may be, as is so often the case, that looking for the logic in Trumps comments is a pointless exercise. But they might provide an outline, at least, of a world view. When Trump told the Times that his uncle would tell me many years ago about the power of weapons someday, that the destructive force of these weapons would be so massive, that its going to be a scary world, maybe his point was that the world is a scary place, and thus well-suited for a politician like him, who traffics in fear.
 

 Then there is the domestic side. Trump brings up his Uncle John on subjects that have nothing to do with technology, such as when the Washington Post asked him about his tendency to use crude language and insult people. Trump said that that wouldnt continue when he was Presidentand why not? My uncle, I would say my uncle was one of the brilliant people. He was at M.I.T. for thirty-five years. As a great scientist and engineer, actually more than anything else, Dr. John Trumpa great guy. That was followed not by a quote from his uncle about, say, the importance of treating people decently, but by the simple statement: Im an intelligent person. This is the professors other role in the Trump rhetorical universe: as a sort of eugenic guarantor of intelligence and breeding.
 

 It is a theme that comes up often. I had a father who was successful, Trump told CNN, in 2010. And, you know, I have a certain gene. Im a gene believer. Hey, when you connect two race horses, you usually end up with a fast horse. In South Carolina, earlier this year, he noted, Dr. John Trump at M.I.T.; good genes, very good genes, O.K., very smart, the Wharton School of Finance, very good, very smart. (Donald Trump was at Wharton as an undergraduate, after transferring from Fordham.) To the Boston Globe: My fathers brother was a brilliant man . . . We have very good genetics. And then on NBC, after telling Lester Holt that his uncle was a professor at M.I.T.: I mean its a good gene pool right therehe pointed to his headI have to do what I have to do.
 

 Looking at Trumps ideological assemblage, one can see certain common connectorsfatalism, fear, and a social-Darwinists contempt for those who dont do quite as well as he and his family have. Being born rich isnt luck; its something to congratulate oneself on when one looks in the mirror. The opposite is true of the losers. Its part of what can make Trump feel both like a doomsayer and a smug child. In his rallies, he has taken to giving dramatic readings of the lyrics of a song, by Al Wilson, called The Snake, which he presents as a parable about the dangers of immigration: a woman saw a beautiful snake at the side of the road, almost dead from the cold. She took it home, warmed it up, saved its life, and clutched it to her bosomTrump always emphasizes that phrasewhereupon it bit her. As she died from the venom, she asked why. You knew damn well I was a snake! Trump shouts. The world is scary; people dont change. All a Trump can do is ride down an escalator to the lobby in Trump Tower, past the gold fittings and the waterfall, and say that hes running for President. Then come the sparks."
191,snopes76,0,http://archive.is/jv9R1,People are scromiting after smoking too much cannabis,"Weed is having a profound and disturbing effect on some long-term users
 

 Cannabis is having a truly hideous effect on some unlucky stoners in the US, where it has recently been legalized in some states.
 

 Doctors said users have been taken to hospital after suffering extreme bouts of scromiting which means they are screaming and vomiting at the same time.
 

 This new word was invented by staff at emergency rooms across the US, who are seeing more and more people turn up yelling in pain and throwing up all over the place.
 

 Its believed the scromiting is caused by a condition called Cannabinoid Hyperemesis Syndrome (CHS) which affects people who have consumed weed for a long period of time.
 

 The illness is not properly understood, but its known that the only guaranteed way to stop it is for sufferers to give up smoking cannabis altogether. Some people also get temporary relief by taking a hot bath.
 

  If you find yourself scromiting after too much weed, you might want to take a bath and think about giving up cannabis (Picture: Getty)
 

 Chalfonte LeNee Queen, a 47-year-old from San Diego, has experienced this grim condition.
 

 She said the pain was sometimes so bad that she ended up on the floor, retching and wracked with pain.
 

 Ive cried out for my mom, whos been dead for 20 years, mentally not realizing she cant come to me.
 

 The illness strikes users who have been smoking regularly for a long time, with one study suggesting people would need to consume cannabis between three and fives time a day to develop CHS.
 

 The syndrome was first described in 2004 by Allen and colleagues and is characterized by chronic cannabis use, cyclic episodes of nausea and vomiting, and the learned behaviour of hot bathing, doctors wrote.
 

  Doctors have been stunned by the new condition, which appears to be becoming more common in America after the herb was legalised (Photo: AFP)
 

 Its been suggested that CHS is caused by a build-up of cannabinoids in the body over a long period of time.
 

 This may affect the function of cannabinoid receptors in a part of the brain called the hypothalamus which regulates the digestive system and body temperature.
 

 The cannabis magazine High Times gave the following description of the illness : Often mistakenly called Cyclical Vomiting Syndrome, Cannabinoid Hyperemesis Syndrome is a rare form of cannabinoid toxicity that develops in chronic smokers.
 

 Its characterized by cyclic episodes of debilitating nausea and vomiting. People who suffer from the syndrome often find that hot showers relieve their symptoms, and will compulsively bathe during episodes of nausea and vomiting. Symptoms stop after cessation of cannabis use."

 The department stores website features more than a dozen search results for the word Palestine, including shirts that read Free Gaza, End Israeli Occupation and other similar phrases.
 

 One shirt design features the image of a head-covered terrorist inside the shape of a Palestinian flag, while another shirt sports a clenched fist in the colors of the Palestinian flag.
 

 Perhaps the most controversial item on the site is a shirt that reads Free Palestine over an image of the outline of the entire state of Israel.
 

 The shirts all appeared to be sold by German clothing company Spread Shirt.
 

 Jewish advocacy group Bnai Brith issued a statement saying: We are appalled at Sears jumping into a geo-political issue by selling glib t-shirts that proclaim Free Palestine seriously?
 

 After reports began circulating on social media, the hashtag #BoycottSears reemerged Tuesday morning.
 

 The same hashtag was used back in February after Sears and other retailers announced they would no longer sell some items from Ivanka Trumps clothing and accessories line."

 On Thursday, 52-year-old Tracy Garcia was attacked by a pack of seven dogs all weighing less than 40 pounds and shorter than knee-length near her home on Banyon Road in Ardmore, Oklahoma, reports KXII News 12.
 

 From what it appeared, about seven dogs had attacked her, Carter County Sheriff Chris Bryant told Oklahoma News Four, adding that when authorities arrived on the scene, one of the dogs charged at them, and they ultimately had to shoot the canine.
 

 Unfortunately, yes, we had to shoot one dog, Bryant told the outlet. It did charge our deputies and to protect our deputies, as well as the medical personnel, we did have to put down a dog.
 

 The remaining six dogs were euthanized at their owners request, according to KXII News 12.

 According to the euthanasia technician, Amanda Dinwiddie, all of the dogs were standard dachshund also known as sausage or weiner dogs mixes, with six of the canines being a mix of dachshund and terrier, while the other was believed to be a border collie mix.
 

 A predominant breed in these dogs is definitely standard dachshund, Dinwiddie told KXII-12. They have really noticeable characteristics like their knobby legs, knees, very short legged dogs and their coats.
 

 Dinwiddie added that the dogs three of which were females and the other four males ranged from probably a year to about three years old.

 

 In addition, Dinwiddie said that the dogs did not have any visible health concerns, but noted that they were all infested with fleas and ticks.
 

 This is a bad situation, a very unfortunate situation, Carter County Sheriff Chris Bryant told KTEN News.
 

 Our thoughts and prayers go out to the family of the victims, he added. This is just a bad deal all the way around.
 

 According to KXII 12, Bryant says the incident, which is still under investigation, will be turned over to the District Attorneys office for review."
194,snopes79,0,http://edition.cnn.com/US/9606/22/hillary.book/index.html,Book says Hillary talks to dead,"First lady acknowledged 'imaginary' chats.
 
First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton held imaginary conversations with Eleanor Roosevelt and Mahatma Gandhi as a therapeutic release, according to a new book written by Bob Woodward, says a report in Sunday's edition of The Chicago Sun-Times.
 

 The first lady declined a personal adviser's suggestion that she address Jesus Christ, however, because it would be ""too personal,"" according to Woodward's book, ""The Choice.""
 

 The book, which is still to be published, takes a behind-the-scenes look at the Clintons, as well as Bob and Elizabeth Dole.
 

 Woodward says the adviser was Jean Houston, co-director of the Foundation for Mind Research, which he describes as a group that studies the psychic experience and altered and expanded consciousness.
 

 The book portrays Houston as an influential adviser who urged Mrs. Clinton to write her book, ""It Takes a Village and Other Lessons Children Teach Us,"" and in the process ""virtually moved into the White House"" for days at a time to help with revisions, the Sun-Times reported.
 

 Woodward suggests the White House hoped to keep Mrs. Clinton's relationship with Houston and her talks with the dead a secret.
 

 ""Most people in the White House did not know about Hillary's sessions with Houston. ... To some of the few who did, the meetings could trigger politically damaging comparisons to Nancy Reagan's use of astrology,"" Woodward wrote.
 

 Mrs. Clinton's spokeswoman, Lisa Caputo, is quoted in the Sun-Times as saying the first lady's interest in Houston is no secret.
 

 Woodward says anthropologist Mary Catherine Bateson, daughter of famed anthropologist Margaret Mead, joined her in sessions of imaginary conversations.
 

 Woodward is an assistant managing editor at The Washington Post. As a reporter, he helped break the Watergate scandal with Carl Bernstein.
 

 Mrs. Clinton herself wrote about her imaginary conversations with Eleanor Roosevelt in her June 10 column. She said she talked to Roosevelt about the role of a first lady.
 

 ""She usually responds by telling me to buck up, or at least to grow skin as thick as a rhinoceros,"" Mrs. Clinton wrote.
 

 In the column, she described Houston as an expert on philosophy and mythology. ""(Houston) has shared her views with me on everything from the ancient Greeks to the lives of women and children on Bangladesh,"" she wrote.
 

 Mrs. Clinton also acknowledged her relationship with Bateson.
 

 ""She and I have spent hours discussing the ways in which women in different societies attempt to fulfill their responsibilities to their families, jobs and communities,"" Mrs. Clinton wrote.

195,snopes8,0,http://www.kpbs.org/news/2012/nov/12/us-veterans-banished-mexico/,US Veterans Banished To Mexico,"How many U.S. veterans are deported each year? No one knows, but a group of ""banished veterans"" in Mexico are trying to help.

 Hector Barajas lives in a rundown apartment in Rosarito, Mexico. His small living room is cluttered with makeshift items appropriated as furniture: upended 20-gallon bucket chairs, chipped TV dinner trays trying to stand alone on teetering bent legs. There's even a door-less broken fridge that serves as a bookshelf.

After growing up in Compton, California, Barajas served for seven years in the U.S Army's 82nd Airborne Division. He had a green card, and was proud to serve what he considered to be his country.

Now, Barajas says, he never imagined he'd be banned for life from the United States.

""I was a legal resident when I entered the military in 1995,"" he said. ""I got out in 2001 with two honorable discharges. I was under the impression that I was a U.S. citizen automatically because of the recruiters.""

That wasn't the case. Though military service can speed up the process of becoming a citizen, it's not automatic. Barajas got into trouble after leaving the military, and was convicted for discharging a firearm into a vehicle. He served a 3-year prison sentence. Because he had a green card, the conviction meant that he was subject to mandatory deportation.

If he had been a U.S. citizen, Barajas would have walked free after serving his time. Instead, he was taken into ICE custody, brought across the border, and dropped off in Tijuana.

His family remained behind in California.

For the first few months, Barajas struggled to adjust. With help from another deported veteran, he found a modest apartment in Rosarito, about 15 miles south of the border. He's been there since 2004.

At first, Barajas says, he found work in a senior care facility in his neighborhood, tending to elderly American retirees. The job paid poorly, and didn't last. His hopes of eventually returning to the U.S. and a desire to help other deported vets led him to his next job: a fulltime, unpaid, effort.

Barajas decided to use his cramped living quarters as a makeshift drop-in shelter, which quickly became the headquarters of the growing organization ""Banished Veterans.""

""I'm doing something that somebody did for me, when I first got here,"" Barajas said. ""You're supposed to take care, you're supposed to leave no man behind. I'm a firm believer""

He trailed off, looked around, and chuckled. ""I mean, to the best of your ability. This is a small apartment.""

Fabian Rebolledo, 36, is a recent arrival to Mexico. He's a Kosovo combat vet and former Army paratrooper. Rebolledo arrived just four months ago, after spending twenty-four years in Los Angeles.

""My deportation was due to a violation of probation,"" he said. ""It was due to a insufficient funds check. Seven hundred fifty dollars.""

Like Barajas, Rebolledo thought that military service would protect him.

""I was a legal resident,"" he said. ""And actually, I joined the military because I wanted to become a citizen. I was going to be the first member of my family to become a citizen""

But before the bad check, Rebolledo had two DUI convictions. Although his crimes were nonviolent, they were still enough to ban him from the U.S. for the rest of his life.

That's because of a 1996 immigration law that expanded the list of crimes considered to be ""aggravated felonies."" The law made some misdemeanor crimes result in permanent, mandatory deportation for non-citizens.

Today, Hector and his fellow banned veterans would like to see some judicial discretion come into play in these cases, taking military service into account. Some politicians, like Bob Filner, former Chairman of the House Committee on Veteran's Affairs and newly elected Mayor of San Diego, have shown some sympathy for these efforts.



Right now, not only is there no judicial review  there's also no one keeping count of how many vets are deported.

""No, no,"" said Lauren Mack, spokesperson for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in San Diego. ""We don't track vets.""

Neither does anyone else.

Immigration attorney Craig Shagin says that getting hard numbers is impossible. Even attorneys representing vets in court, ""may not even be asking their clients, 'have you ever served in the military?' Because it isn't an outcome affirmative of anything, it's not going to change anything.""

From the Banned Vet headquarters in his Rosarito apartment, Barajas has been keeping a tally. ""I started making a list of for the hell of it,"" he said. ""It grew into something bigger, something people want to know about.""

Today, he says, he's spoken personally to 103 U.S. military veterans who have been deported to various countries. He estimates that between 500 and 1000 deported vets live in Tijuana and Rosarito alone, with thousands more scattered around the world.

Barajas is searching for other deported vets and trying to rally them and others. It's a lot like amateur detective work. He makes phones calls, follows leads, sends Facebook requests, and tracks social media.

Vets who commit crimes, do time, and are then deported can still be eligible for benefits. However, it's impossible for them to collect most of those benefits.



Nevertheless, there is one benefit they can collect: burial.

""We had a guy who died about four months ago,"" Barajas said. ""He was deported, not allowed to go into the U.S. When (he) died, they let his body go. And then they gave him a nice certificate, thank you for serving our country. When I die, I can be buried as an American.""

It's true. Unless they've been dishonorably discharged, the Office of Veteran's Affairs says that all military veterans are indeed entitled to a burial in a national cemetery.

Immigration law doesn't restrict the corpses of veterans from coming ""home"" to American soil.

Only then can deported vets re-enter the country legally, in order to be laid to rest as American service members: with a grave marker and a American flag.

196,snopes80,0,https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/alex-azar-trumps-hhs-pick-has-already-been-a-disaster-for-people-with-diabetes/,"Alex Azar, Trump’s HHS Pick, Has Already Been a Disaster for People With Diabetes","Last year The New York Times published an op-ed urging the break up of the “insulin racket.” But rather than break it up, Trump has nominated one of its architects, Alex Azar, for secretary of Health and Human Services.

From 2007 to 2017, Azar worked for pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly. While he was a senior VP, Lilly paid a record $1.415 billion to settle a case on its off-label promotion of the antipsychotic Zyprexa. Rising up the ranks, Azar became president of Lilly USA, the largest division of Eli Lilly, in 2012, a position he held until resigning in January of this year.

During Azar’s tenure, Eli Lilly raised the prices on its insulins in the United States by 20.8 percent in 2014, 16.9 percent in 2015, and 7.5 percent in 2016. Eli Lilly’s biggest seller, Humalog insulin, is now off-patent. But rather than becoming cheaper, Humalog costs more now than when it first came to market in 1996. When Azar started working at Eli Lilly in June 2007, the list price for a vial of Humalog was $74. When he quit in January 2017, it was $269.

At T1International we asked people with type 1 diabetes around the world how much they paid each month to stay alive. The United States topped every country, spending on average $571.69 per month on diabetes costs. Even with insurance, some Americans are spending around half their income on insulin and other supplies.
In fact, price gouging from Eli Lilly and other insulin manufacturers has already had deadly consequences. Shane Patrick Boyle, a founder of Zine Fest Houston, died on March 18 after his GoFundMe campaign to pay for insulin came up $50 short. Alec Raeshawn Smith, age 26, was found dead in his apartment on June 27. He was rationing his insulin after he aged out of his parent’s insurance coverage. The sad fact is more people would be alive today if insulin was affordable for all Americans.

Contrary to pharma propaganda, insulin is neither “new” nor “innovative.” It was developed in Toronto in 1921. The discoverers turned down the chance to create for-profit clinics. Instead, they licensed their creation for $1 (Canadian) a piece. Their recorded reason for doing this was to make sure insulin would be available for all who needed it. Eli Lilly’s was tasked with manufacturing insulin for North America. There was an understanding insulin would be sold at a reasonable price until there was a cure for diabetes.

What difference a century makes! Eli Lilly is currently under investigation by multiple state attorneys general for price fixing. It is also named in a class-action lawsuit that alleges that it colluded with Novo Nordisk and Sanofi to keep the prices in the US insulin market rising. These “Big 3” insulin makers control over 90 percent of the global market and maintain their lock on it in many ways. One is “pay-for-delay schemes,” like when Sanofi paid Eli Lilly to delay the launch of an insulin similar to its Lantus brand. Another is to sue potential competitors for intellectual property infringement, such as when Merck attempted to enter the insulin market in 2016. The companies also funnel money into patient-advocacy groups, both big and small. This might explain the inaction or even outright opposition of these groups on measures that may rein in prices. 
At first glance Trump’s decision to appoint Azar is surprising. Public support for lower drug prices is at an all-time high. Why hire a man directly responsible for raising the price of a drug that millions depend on? The reason becomes clear once you review the campaign contributions. Azar’s Lilly spent millions lobbying Congress, the Department of Health and Human Services, spending $5.7 million in 2016 alone. The company has deep ties to the Trump administration. Lilly’s current CEO, David Ricks, was one of the first business leaders to meet with Trump after his inauguration. Ricks has publicly and repeatedly backed Trump’s tax-reform plans. Vice President Mike Pence also knows Azar well from his time as governor of Indiana, where Eli Lilly is headquartered. Clearly the Trump administration and Alex Azar feel they have a friend in each other.

Alex Azar was part of pharma-lobby group Biotechnology Innovation Organization (BIO) until this year. When you ask pharma-lobby groups like BIO to explain why drugs cost so much, they’ll tell you “it’s complicated.”

In fact, it is simple. Drugs cost far too much. There are all sorts of ideas on how to bring prices down. Allow Medicare to negotiate drug prices. Let private citizens buy their drugs abroad. Mandate transparency on the dealings between drug companies, pharmacies, and middlemen called pharmacy benefit managers, as the State of Nevada did this year with SB539, a bill with bipartisan support.

We can expect Alex Azar to pursue none of these options. Looking at his track record, you can bet he will continue to back pharma-friendly approaches. Expect the Orwellian phrase “value-based pricing” to be commonplace. Since insulin literally keeps people alive, the Big 3 insulin producers have already tried to argue that value is a good reason to keep the prices high. The fact that insulin is almost 100 years old and costing pennies on the dollar to be produced means little when next quarter’s revenue is at stake. 
Trump has repeatedly called for drug-price reform. Last year he called out big pharma for “getting away with murder.” Yet by nominating Azar he just sent a clear message to industry. It’s open season.

Oppose this nomination."
197,snopes81,0,https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-inmates-fighting-californias-deadly-fires,Inmates Are Fighting Californias Deadliest Fires,"For $2 a day or $1 an hour, scores of men and women are fighting the wildfires ravaging Californias wine country.
 

 Theyre on call 7 days a week, on the frontlines, and make up 35 to 40 percent of Cal Fire, the states firefighting force.
 

 And theyre inmates serving time for nonviolent crimes. In recent years, some residents have called them angels in orange.
 

 Its a real good experience. Its better than sitting (in the prison) yard. I like getting in there and helping people, one 33-year-old inmate, Deshan Heard, told the OC Register this week. Heard, of Los Angeles, is serving six years behind bars for robbery.
 

 Heard is assigned to one of 43 conservation camps across the state, a network of prison-funded fire companies from the borders of Oregon to Mexico. The convict crew, run by the California Department of Correction and Rehabilitation and in part by Cal Fire or the Los Angeles Fire Department, has roughly 3,800 to 4,000 inmates a week.
 

 About 200 of those inmates are women, battling a rash of infernos that are the deadliest California has ever seen. The fires have claimed the lives of 31 people as of Thursday night and left at least 400 people missing.
 

 On Monday, a day after the blazes started, Gov. Jerry Brown declared a state of emergency for swaths of Northern Californias wine country, including Napa and Sonoma counties. The fires wiped out entire neighborhoods in Santa Rosa, decimating about 2,834 homes and 400,000 square feet of commercial space.
 

 Given this devastation, We need every firefighter we can get, whether its an inmate or not, said corrections spokesman Bill Sessa.
 

 One firefighter, Sandra Welsh, told NBC News recently, We are the ones that do the line. We are the ones that carry the hose out. Were the line of defense. Welshs Malibu camp was on standby as firefighters battle a brush fire in Anaheim Hills. Women make up three of the programs conservation camps, Sessa said.
 

 As of Friday morning, about 235 jailbirds turned firefighters were assigned to Canyon Fire 2 in Anaheim Hills, Sessa said. Meanwhile, roughly 300 were assigned to hot spots in Sonoma, Solano, and Napa counties.
 

 Today alone we have 1,700 inmates (or about 16 crews) on a fire line somewhere, Sessa said, adding, We are not only fighting fires, but we also have to provide backup fire protection in parts of the state that are not burning.
 

 During these massive fires, its common for inmate crews to work 24 straight hours, followed by a day of rest. The inmates, wearing orange jumpsuits, put in the same hours as their civilian brethren in yellow suits. (The professionals make a minimum of $17.70 an hour, according to one AFP report.)

 As Santa Rosa fires raged, some crews worked 72 hours before they got 24 hours of rest, Sessa said. Like civilians, the inmates work in rough terrain, carrying hand tools and 60 pounds of gear on their backs.
 

 We tell all the guys we pick: We will treat you like a firefighter. We will only treat you like an inmate if you make us do it, Sessa told The Daily Beast. That happens very rarely. Most inmates in these camps have earned the right to be chosen based on rehabilitation work while they are serving their sentence in regular prison.
 

 The program, which started in the 1940s, is constantly replenishing its ranks because the inmates complete their sentences or are paroled. Sessa stresses that placement in the fire crews is voluntary.
 

 But last month, a candidate for lieutenant governor called the program slave labor and abuse on her website.
 

 No matter how you may want to dress it up, if you have people working for nothing or almost nothing, youve got slave labor, and it is not acceptable, wrote Gayle McLaughlin, a former mayor of Richmond, California.
 

 In response to such criticism, Sessa told The Daily Beast that people make slave labor claims because theyre looking from the outside in.
 

 On occasion you have a fringe candidate for elective office who thinks its a great sound byte to stick in a headline, but if you look at it from the inmates perspective, its difficult to call them enslaved when theyre volunteering to do the job, Sessa said.
 

 Every inmate working in a fire camp raised their hand and volunteered to do it, he added.
 

 Sessa said the $1-an-hour for fire prevention is the highest paying job for a California inmate and has rehabilitative value. Some inmates, he said, have never even held a job before joining the firefighting program.
 

 When the inmates arent on call, they earn $2 a day while at the camp.
 

 If theyre raising their hand and volunteering to do it and getting $76,000 a year in benefits before they ever go to camp, then this whole argument about enslavement makes no sense, Sessa said, referring to what he said was the prison systems annual cost to house an inmate.
 

 Sessa estimated the state of California is saving taxpayers $90 million to $100 million a year through the program.
 

 These inmates are not necessarily confined to fighting fires where they camp, Sessa said. Quite often they move hundreds of miles in a day, depending on where theyre needed.
 

 All of these inmates can be moved in a moment, he said, adding that crews from San Diego are working in Sonoma. They move constantly.
 

 The firefighters work in crews of 14 people. They live in supervised fire camps when theyre not in the field. When theyre not on a fire, they usually work on fire prevention or conservation projects, such as cutting brush or taking out a grove of diseased trees.
 

 While TV footage shows civilian firefighters in airplanes or water trucks, the inmates have a different role: They cut fire breaks by handor clear stretches of landto stop the spread of flames, Sessa said.
 

 When you hear on the news that a fire is X percent contained, that is in some part from what our crews do, Sessa said.
 

 The inmates use hand tools, with a lead firefighter using a chainsaw to cut trees and others using axes and shovels. Every person in line has a job related to the person behind them in line, Sessa added.
 

 Still, the work is not without danger. This year, two inmates died in the line of fire.
 

 Matthew Beck, 26, died in May when a 120-foot tree uprooted and crushed him in Humboldt County, about 300 miles north of San Francisco. Beck was serving six years for a 2014 burglary in Los Angeles County.
 

 In July, Frank Anaya was killed in San Diego after he slashed his leg with a chainsaw. The 22-year-old died after undergoing several surgeries. Anaya, of Ventura County, was serving a three-year sentence for spousal assault and weapons offenses.
 

 Anayas fatal injury marked the fifth death in the programs 40-year history. When you consider the decades this has been in place, the safety record has been outstanding, Sessa said when asked about those who lost their lives.
 

 A debate has long swirled around the program.
 

 As The Daily Beast previously reported, the California attorney generals office argued against an early prison-release program in 2014 because they believed it would severely impact fire camp participation.
 

 In response, David Fathi, director of the ACLUs National Prison Project, said such dangerous work outside of prison walls had a risk of government abuse. The inmate firefighters may also not be aware of the long-term health risks, he said.
 

 Yet in the press, the prisoners themselves are praising their roles.
 

 This is the first time in a long time my family is proud of me, Travis Reeder, a 23-year-old imprisoned for drug dealing, recently told AFP.
 

 In 2015, one firefighting convict said he volunteered for the program because the conservation camp gave him freedom.
 

 Then-34-year-old Joshua Coover told the East Bay Times that working all night to clear hazardous vegetation was the best feeling in the world.
 

 The best feeling is when we get off the fire; all the signs you see that say thank you, firefighters,' Coover told the Times. They even refer to us as the angels in orange.'"

199,snopes83,0,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/benghazi-committee-democrats-say-gowdy-ignoring-statements-by-ex-gop-counsel,Benghazi Committee Democrats say Gowdy ignoring statements by ex-GOP counsel,"The House Benghazi committee's Republican chairman is ignoring statements by his own former lawyer indicating that the U.S. military acted properly on the night of the deadly Sept. 11, 2012, attacks in Libya, the panel's Democrats said.

Reps. Elijah Cummings and Adam Smith said Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., omitted the lawyer's comments when he fired back at the Defense Department for criticizing the GOP-led investigation into the attacks that killed four Americans.

Gowdy's actions, coupled with delays that have pushed the 2-year-old inquiry into the heat of the 2016 presidential race, ""have damaged the credibility of the Select Committee beyond repair,"" Cummings and Smith wrote Sunday in a letter to Gowdy.

The Associated Press obtained a copy of the letter.

Cummings of Maryland is the senior Democrat on the Benghazi panel; Smith, of Washington state, is the senior Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee. He also serves on the select Benghazi panel.

The criticism by the two Democrats is the latest volley in an escalating, election-year fight over the Benghazi panel's actions. The panel, created in May 2014, has not conducted a public hearing since October, when former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton testified.

Democrats call the panel a thinly veiled excuse for Republicans to criticize Clinton, the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination. Republicans say the Obama administration has dragged its feet, failing to produce needed documents or interview subjects, delaying a final report.

U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens was among those died during the twin assaults nearly four years ago. Previous investigations blamed management failures at the State Department for a lack of security at the U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi, an issue that has dogged Clinton and other Obama administration officials.

Cummings and Smith cite comments by retired Army Lt. Gen. Dana Chipman, who served as chief counsel for Republicans on the Benghazi panel from August 2014 until last January.

Chipman ""repeatedly commended the military's actions on the night of the attacks during closed interviews with Defense Department officials,"" Cummings and Smith wrote.

Chipman, a former judge advocate general for the Army, attended a closed-door interview with former Defense Secretary Leon Panetta on Jan. 8.

Cummings and Smith quote Chipman as telling Panetta: ""I think you ordered exactly the right forces to move out and to head toward a position where they could reinforce what was occurring in Benghazi or Tripoli or elsewhere in the region. And, sir, I don't disagree with the actions you took, the recommendations you made and the decisions you directed.""

Chipman later told Panetta he was ""worried"" that U.S. officials were caught by surprise during the Benghazi raids, which occurred on the anniversary of the 9/11 attacks. Still, Chipman told Panetta: ""Nothing could have affected what occurred in Benghazi,"" Cummings and Smith wrote.

The letter from the Democrats comes after Gowdy sent a letter to Defense Secretary Ash Carter complaining that a top Pentagon official had intentionally mischaracterized the House inquiry.

Gowdy said comments by Stephen C. Hedger, assistant secretary of defense for legislative affairs, were ""riddled with factual inaccuracies"" and did ""a disservice to the public"" and employees at the Defense Department.

Hedger, in an April 28 letter to Gowdy, expressed frustration with the Benghazi panel, citing a ""crescendo"" of costly, duplicative and unnecessary requests, including a few based on claims made on Facebook or talk radio."
200,snopes84,0,http://archive.is/sBwGK,Mother develops infection after trimming her PUBIC HAIR | Daily Mail," A mother-of-three has spoken of her terror after she almost lost her legs to a deadly infection which she caught from shaving her bikini line.
 

 Dana Sedgewick, 44, from Sheffield, trimmed her pubic area with a brand new razor but ended up cutting a spot on her groin.
 

 Her body almost immediately went into shock, causing a red rash on her legs before they turned black from necrotising fasciitis - a flesh-eating infection.
 

 Rushed to intensive care, doctors operated to remove as much of the rotting skin as they could - but she developed sepsis during the procedure.
 

 She was placed in a coma as her family were told she had just a 30 per cent chance of survival as her kidneys failed and her heart stopped four times.
 

 Having managed to survive the horrific ordeal, she underwent 21 operations to repair the damage to her skin - but doctors warned she would never walk again.
 

 But with the support of her husband, Mathew, 47, she has now recovered and can walk using crutches and is back at home with her children - Megan, 18, Freya, 14, and Klara, nine.
 

 Dana Sedgewick, 44, trimmed her pubic area with a brand new razor, but ended up in a coma after she developed the flesh-eating infection, necrotising fasciitis (pictured now, using a crutch to walk - despite being told she may never be able to use her legs again)
 

 Mrs Sedgewick said: 'Like a lot of women, I tried to keep a tidy bikini line. So I had a quick trim with a new razor.
 

 'But over the weekend, I felt unwell and noticed a little pimple on my groin which kept bleeding. I didn't think anything of it as I often got a rash from shaving.
 

 'Little did I know that this tiny pimple would almost cost me my life.'
 

 Mrs Sedgewick's ordeal began in May 2012. Two days after she'd shaved, she began experiencing dizziness and nausea.
 

 She visited her GP, who took swabs of the area and prescribed her antibiotics to combat a suspected infection.
 

 Later that day, her eldest daughter Megan discovered her lying in bed, with her legs covered in a bloody red rash.
 

 Her body almost immediately went into shock, causing a red rash on her legs before they turned black from the rotting flesh (pictured in September 2012 after a couple of skin graft procedures to repair some of the damage on her legs)
 

 Afterwards, her GP called to say that the swabs had revealed it was serious and that she needed to go in for another examination.
 

 But when her husband dropped her off at the surgery, she collapsed.

 An ambulance was called and she was rushed to the trauma unit at the Northern General Hospital in Sheffield, where doctors diagnosed her with necrotising fasciitis.
 

 The condition causes bacteria to release toxins that attack the surrounding soft tissue, and can be caused by a minor cut or scratch.
 

 Mrs Sedgewick said: 'By the time I got to the hospital, my legs were covered in black, rotting flesh. It was touch-and-go as to whether I'd make it.'
 

 Over the next ten hours, surgeons battled to save her legs. Cutting through seven inches of infected skin, they removed the diseased flesh and reapplied skin from her back.

 Doctors told Mrs Sedgewick that she had been very lucky to survive her terrifying ordeal with necrotising fasciitis (pictured in hospital in June 2012)
 

 During surgery, she developed sepsis and was given a slim chance of survival after going into septic shock.
 

 The silent killer strikes when an infection such as blood poisoning sparks a violent immune response in which the body attacks its own organs.
 

 To increase her chances of survival, doctors decided to put her into an induced coma for nine days.
 

 She said: 'When I woke up, my legs were covered in bandages and I had no idea what had happened. I thought I'd been in a car accident.
 

 'But when the surgeon asked me if I remembered shaving, I suddenly recalled trimming my bikini line.
 

 'He told me that the spot on my groin had become infected, and I'd been very lucky to survive.'
 

 Mrs Sedgewick was transferred to the hospital's burns unit for specialist treatment, and was able to see her legs for the first time.
 

 She said: 'It was horrific. All of my muscle had rotted away, and I had a crater of skin near my groin. I felt like I was going to throw up.
 

 'But I knew that it could have been much, much worse. I could easily have lost my legs - or worse, died.'

 WHAT IS NECROTISING FASCIITIS? Necrotising fasciitis is most commonly caused by an infection with group A Streptococcus. Those infections normally last just a few days - they are mild and typically clear themselves up. But in some unusual cases it can develop into necrotising fasciitis. They infect flat layers of a membrane known as the fascia, which are connective bands of tissue that surround muscles, nerves, fat, and blood vessels. The infection also damages the tissues next to the fascia. Sometimes toxins made by these bacteria destroy the tissue they infect, causing it to die. When this happens, the infection is very serious and can result in loss of limbs or death. .
 

 Doctors warned that she'd never walk again but she defied them and managed to walk on crutches, after intense physiotherapy.
 

 Six weeks later, she was discharged from hospital.
 

 Over the next four years, she underwent 21 operations to improve the appearance of her skin.
 

 Mrs Sedgewick, who has been left with extensive scarring, said: 'It didn't feel like my own body any more.
 

 'But with Mat's support, I grew to see the scars as a reminder of how brave I'd been, and how lucky I was to survive.
 

 'It's incredible to think a tiny shaving spot could have killed me. I had a very close shave indeed.'
 

 Dr Ron Daniels BEM, chief executive of the UK Sepsis Trust, said: 'Stories like Dana's illustrate the serious damage sepsis can do. Every day in the UK, individuals and families have their lives torn apart by the condition.
 

 'But through better awareness, thousands of lives could be saved each year.
 

 'While necrotising fasciitis is a rare cause of sepsis, it's crucial that members of the public and healthcare professionals consider it when presented with an unwell patient.
 

 'Anyone with flu-like symptoms and one or more of the key signs of sepsis must call an ambulance immediately. With every hour that passes before the correct antibiotics are administered, the risk of death increases.'

These are the moments when everything seems to click, and people leap forward into their careers.
 

 Before he was Ivan Drago, He-Man or an ""Expendable,"" Dolph Lundgren was just another 6-foot-5-inch Swedish male model with a black belt in karate and a degree in chemical engineering.
 

 As even a brief reading of his biography might suggest, Lundgren, 56, has taken an unexpected, winding path to success. But it all started with his starring role in Rocky IV, as the menacing Soviet boxer Ivan Drago.
 

 As he tells NPR's Arun Rath, it was the role that changed his life. And he wouldn't have gotten to that silver-screen spotlight if he hadn't taken a gig as a bouncer and stumbled upon romance.

 A Childhood In Sweden, And Dreams Of America
 

 The movie star ""Dolph"" Lundgren was actually born Hans Lundgren. (He took on the name Dolph, a relative's name from his mother's side of the family, with the release of the Rocky film in 1985.) He grew up largely in and around Stockholm, and excelled in school from an early age.
 

 ""I had some allergies when I was younger,"" Lundgren says, and, as a result, ""I wasn't very good at sports. So my kind of way to feel like I was somebody was to answer all the questions the teacher asked.""
 

 From early on, Lundgren also dreamed of going to the United States, but, he says, his family couldn't afford to send him: ""So the way to get there for me was to get academic scholarships.""
 

 Lundgren's aptitude for chemical engineering propelled him to scholarships around the world. There was Washington State University, Clemson University, Sweden's Royal Institute of Technology, the University of Sydney in Australia and, ultimately, a competitive Fulbright scholarship to attend MIT.
 

 But that was all before Lundgren met Grace Jones.
 

 A Taste Of Show Business
 

 While in Australia, Lundgren, then a competitive martial artist, got a job as a bouncer through a friend of a friend. That meant he provided security at concerts for artists like Joan Armatrading, Dr. Hook and Grace Jones.
 

 ""I was assigned to [Jones'] dressing room,"" Lundgren recalls. ""I think she spotted me out there. And I was just a Swedish kid, I didn't know anything. And I think she kind of liked me.""
 

 A night of partying after Jones' show led to a four-year romance and a major course correction on Lundgren's trajectory toward MIT.
 

 ""She changed it big time,"" Lundgren says.
 

 Jones who was famous not just for her music, but also for her acting and modeling took Lundgren to New York, where they partied at the legendary Studio 54 and Andy Warhol took pictures of Lundgren. Jones introduced Lundgren to the world of show business.
 

 Meanwhile, Lundgren was still set to begin his Fulbright scholarship at MIT.
 

 ""I started sort of thinking, 'Wow, this is kind of cool,' "" Lundgren remembers: "" 'I don't know if I want to go back to engineering after this.' ""

 A Short-Lived Scholarship
 

 Lundgren remembers making the trip from New York down to MIT's campus in Cambridge, Mass., riding on a big, black Yamaha motorcycle with Grace Jones behind him.
 

 ""The professors are waiting for the star student from Sweden,"" Lundgren says, ""and then they see me ride past outside the window with Grace Jones in the back, all decked out in leather. They probably didn't know what was going on.""
 

 After his exposure to show business and the arts, it took only a few weeks for Lundgren to rethink his academic goals, quit the program and return to New York.
 

 ""I just knew it wasn't right,"" he says. Instead of studying engineering, he started studying acting.
 

 Becoming The 'Siberian Bull'
 

 The movie role that changed Lundgren's life almost went to someone else.
 

 When the then-unknown actor went to a ""cattle call"" audition for Sylvester Stallone's Rocky IV, a casting agent dismissed Lundgren as ""too tall.""
 

 But given his own aptitude for martial arts and his love for the film series, he says, he couldn't miss the opportunity for a role in the franchise.
 

 So he took photos of himself in boxing gear, and sent them through a series of connections to Stallone.
 

 It happened in like 90 minutes. I went from a total nobody, basically, to Dolph Lundgren, movie star.
 

 Eventually, while back in Sweden, Lundgren got the call to meet with Stallone in Los Angeles.
 

 After meeting Stallone, training for months and going through a screen test, Lundgren landed the role as the villain in Rocky IV, the towering Soviet boxer Ivan Drago.
 

 Lundgren remembers the premiere of the film in November 1985 as a pivotal moment in his career.
 

 He walked down the red carpet with Grace Jones, still his girlfriend at the time, and ""everybody's taking pictures of her,"" he says, ""and I'm kind of there like her boy toy.""
 

 But after the audience watched the film, Lundgren says, everything changed.
 

 ""I remember coming out onto the street, and suddenly people are taking pictures of me, and not Grace,"" he says.
 

 ""It happened in like 90 minutes. I went from a total nobody, basically, to Dolph Lundgren, movie star."""
202,snopes86,0,http://www.arktimes.com/ArkansasBlog/archives/2013/05/17/sen-jeremy-hutchinson-bill-clinton-on-lawyer-suspension-list,"UPDATE: Sen. Jeremy Hutchinson, Bill Clinton on lawyer suspension list","On March 8, the Supreme Court suspended the license offor nonpayment of dues. I've sent him a note asking whether he's cleared the matter up. Hutchinson has been practicing law periodically, including for clients he subsequently helped, coincidentally, with legislation. Not that advocating a former client's interest in the Senate is practicing law (though some might find it unseemly). Hutchinson, with a rambunctious former girlfriend who improperly received some of his campaign cash and a losing legal battle over debts owed a campaign consultant, has had a series of personal problems. More fodder for, who has said she'll run against Hutchinson for Senate next year.
 

 I wonder: Could Hutchinson take referral work from Texarkana plaintiffs' lawyer John Goodson during a suspension? I don't mean to count as legal work being Goodson's highly valuable advocate for a tort reform proposal that sabotaged the Arkansas State Chamber of Commerce's march to a tough tort reform proposal.
 

 On the subject of lawyer dues: Reader Radical Centrist noted on the open line last night that former President Bill Clinton also turned up on the list of Arkansas lawyers suspended March 8 for non-payment of bar dues. The Arkansas Supreme Court record doesn't indicate if he's cleared up the matter and I've sent a query about it. It's not very important. He hasn't been practicing law, being busy with a few other things. He served a five-year suspension that ended in 2006 over testimony he gave in the Whitewater investigations when he became eligible for reinstatement.
 

 UPDATE: Dues are payable between Jan. 1 and March 1 each year. Each attorney gets a letter in December as a reminder. If they are not paid, a computer program automatically suspends a license. Judges in the state got the list yesterday of those suspended, which explains the news coming out yesterday. There were about 700 on the list. Renewal requires only payment of dues and a late fee. A spokesman in the Supreme Court clerk's office said Sen. Hutchinson paid his fee this morning and the website will be updated this evening to show he's in good standing. The annual dues are $200 and the late fee is $100.
 

 As for Bill Clinton: He never applied for reinstatement of his law license after his five-year suspension and hasn't paid dues since 2000. But his name automatically turns up on the list each year regardless. The list of 700 typically includes the names of many lawyers no longer practicing or dead.
 

 A lawyer who practices after a suspension takes effect is practicing without a license. That can potentially have consequences for a client. For example, an attorney might file a pleading in a criminal or civil case that could be held invalid because it wasn't filed by a licensed lawyer. A refiling could come after a statute of limitation had tolled."

 Its unclear if Trump will publicly address the country on the Florida shooting, but his public schedule for Thursday indicates he only has one meeting, which will be closed to the press. The New York Times Maggie Haberman reported Wednesday night that White House aides urged Trump to say something in the wake of the shooting, but he is so far refusing to do so.
 

 Authorities have identified 19-year-old Nikolas Cruz as the suspected gunman, saying he had recently been expelled from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School for disciplinary issues. School officials reportedly identified Cruz as a potential threat who had demonstrated a fixation on guns.
 

 Almost exactly a year ago, Trump signed a law to revoke an Obama-era gun regulation that made it more difficult for those with mental illnesses to acquire guns. Media was not allowed to attend the bill-signing event.

206,snopes9,0,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/05/world/americas/jean-claude-duvalier-haitis-baby-doc-dies-at-63.html,Jean-Claude Duvalier Dies at 63; Ruled Haiti in Fathers Brutal Fashion,"Were there deaths and summary executions under your government? a judge asked him at a hearing in February 2013.

Deaths exist in all countries, Mr. Duvalier replied almost inaudibly. I didnt intervene in the activities of the police.

He dined regularly at restaurants in Port-au-Prince, Haitis capital, and attended events at the invitation of Mr. Martelly, whose administration has included relatives and allies of people associated with Mr. Duvalier.

A brief statement released by Mr. Martellys office said he learned of Mr. Duvaliers death with great sadness and made no mention of the former presidents iron-fisted rule.

On behalf of the entire government and people of Haiti, I take this sad occasion to extend my sincere sympathies to his family, his relatives and his supporters across the country, Mr. Martelly said.

Richard Sassine, a close friend of Mr. Duvalier, told The Miami Herald that Mr. Duvalier had been writing a memoir that would correct misunderstandings about him and his tenure.

He was a gentle giant, Mr. Sassine said. Not this tyrant.

This year, his old political party announced that it would field candidates in elections, and opened an office, though analysts were not sure if it was a serious move or a thumb in the eye of the rival he loathed, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, another formerly exiled president who also returned and still is a political force.

Mr. Duvalier fled Haiti in 1986, as political repression and a worsening economy set off violent unrest in the hemispheres poorest country. He asked France for asylum and the United States for the plane to take him there, an American official said at the time.

His departure set the stage for democratic, though tumultuous, elections four years later that lifted Mr. Aristide, a former priest to the poor, to power. (Years later, he, too, was chased from the country by political upheaval.) Human rights groups have said that Mr. Duvalier looted Haitis treasury of millions of dollars and largely lived off ill-gotten gains.

His presence in the country, and the fact that he will now escape trial, appalled victims and human rights workers who worked to bring him to justice.

On Duvaliers death Im thinking of the look in my mothers eyes when she talks about her brother Joel who was disappeared by that dictator, Patrick Gaspard, a Haitian-American who is the United States ambassador to South Africa, said on Twitter. News of the passing of Duvalier makes me honor my father and generations of Haitians who resisted that vicious dictatorship.

Still, a majority of the population now was born after his departure, perhaps dampening passions for or against him.

He managed with the complicity of foreign powers and domestic politicians to avoid facing justice both when he was in France and when he returned to Haiti in 2011, said Robert Fatton Jr., a University of Virginia professor and the author of Haiti: Trapped in the Outer Periphery. Because he escaped trial, the extent of his crimes and looting will not be fully documented.

Mr. Duvalier was born July 3, 1951, in Port-au-Prince. Biographical sketches published when he became president described him as an introvert who liked fast cars and jazz, and a martial arts enthusiast. He spoke Spanish and French, and attended classes at the University of Haiti, though diplomats whispered that he was unprepared for office, and speculated that his fathers ministers would hold the real power.

He did not have the vision or sense to change what his father left for him, said Amy Wilentz, the author of The Rainy Season: Haiti Since Duvalier and other works on the country. He was like a young prince. His fathers people controlled him, and he never got out from under them.

Mr. Duvalier rarely granted interviews and kept public appearances to a minimum, but details of lavish spending on art, clothing and a wedding believed to have cost $5 million trickled out of the presidential palace.

That marriage was in 1980, to Michele Bennett, the daughter of a wealthy coffee baron, whose worldly ways and outspoken manner led many to believe she was actually running the country. They divorced in 1993.

Whether of his own volition or at the urging of others, Mr. Duvalier took obvious cues from his father, and while occasionally releasing political prisoners or tolerating critical news coverage, he quickly quashed serious dissent.

He curried favor with the United States, and exploited its Cold War aims to ensure that Haiti did not fall under Cubas sway by bargaining for aid, though his government did not receive all that it believed it needed.

Still, investment increased and he pushed urbanization and public works projects, drawing poor farmers from the countryside to such an extent that some argue that agriculture fell into an irreversible decline. The large Haitian diaspora blossomed as people fled and sent money home, buttressing the weak economy.

He welcomed nongovernment organizations to fill in what his government could not or would not do, leading to a heavy presence that still exists today.

The years of Jean-Claude Duvalier were also the time of a ramping up of the current highly fragmented landscape of aid delivery in Haiti, said Laurent Dubois, an expert on modern Haitian history at Duke University.

Jean-Claude Duvalier inherited a carefully constructed state apparatus for political repression from his father, and he largely maintained it during his regime, Mr. Dubois said.

But he also cultivated new connections with the U.S., seeking new types of investment in the country, he added. The model of using small manufacturing to expand the economy  some talked of Haiti becoming the Taiwan of the Caribbean  was a key part of his economic policy, though even he later admitted that its ultimate success in alleviating poverty was quite limited.

As political oppression mounted, so did stories of his extravagances. When he fled Haiti, American officials said he held $200 million to $500 million in foreign bank accounts and had a reputation for giving family members million-dollar vacations at luxury resorts, as millions of Haitians lived in squalor and scrounged for food.

While in exile, he kept a low profile, vowing to return to Haiti before he did so on Jan. 16, 2011.

He said in an interview that the 2010 earthquake that devastated the capital broke his heart, and that he wanted to help rebuild the country, not inject himself into politics or the chaotic presidential election unfolding at the time, eventually won by Mr. Martelly.

But others wondered if he was making a bid to secure money still stashed away.

He looked frail and far thinner than the 250 pounds he once carried on his six-foot frame, and with occasional trips to the hospital, Haitian media speculated that he had returned home to die.

Mr. Duvalier is survived by his companion, Veronique Roy, and a son and daughter from his first marriage, Franois Nicolas and Anya."
207,snopes90,0,http://www.patheos.com/blogs/progressivesecularhumanist/2016/08/mike-pence-condoms-are-too-modern/,Mike Pence: Condoms Are Too Modern,"Mike Pence claims condoms are too modern, and too liberal.
 

 Donald Trumps running mate is a dangerous Christian extremist who wants creationism taught in public schools and believes the government should pay for gay conversion therapy.
 

 In addition, in 2015, as Governor of Indiana, Pence allowed an HIV outbreak to spread, choosing prayer over a clean needle exchange.
 

 But perhaps one of the most idiotic claims made by Pence is that condoms are too modern, too liberal, and offer a poor defense against sexually transmitted infections and diseases.
 

 Pences bizarre and unsubstantiated claims concerning condoms came in 2002, in response to then-Secretary of State Colin Powell saying in an MTV forum that sexually active young people should protect themselves with condoms.
 

 At the time Powell said:
 

 I think its important for young people, especially, to protect themselves from the possibility of acquiring any sexually transmitted disease, but especially to protect themselves from HIV/AIDS, which is a plague that is upon the face of the earth.
 

 In an interview with CNN, while advocating for abstinence only sex education, Pence said Powells call for condom use could mislead millions of young people and put their lives at risk.
 

 Pence told CNNs Wolf Blitzer that it was a sad day because Powell had suggested condoms over abstinence:
 

 Well, Wolf, I think it was given the enormous stature that Colin Powell rightly has, not only in America but in the world community it was a sad day. I dont think any administration has had a worse day since boxers and briefs on MTV. And the truth is that Colin Powell had an opportunity here to reaffirm this presidents commitment to abstinence as the best choice for our young people, and he chose not to do that in the first instance, but and so I think its very sad. The other part is that, frankly, condoms are a very, very poor protection against sexually transmitted diseases, and in that sense, Wolf, this was the secretary of state may be inadvertently misleading millions of young people and endangering lives.
 

 Pence then went on to suggest that condoms are too modern, and too liberal, for him:
 

 The problem is it was too modern of an answer, Wolf. It was it truly was a modern, liberal answer to a problem that parents like me are facing all over America, and frankly, all over the world.
 

 Of course Pence is wrong. His claim that condoms are a very poor protection against sexually transmitted diseases is easy to debunk. The CDC reports:
 

 when used consistently and correctly, condoms are highly effective in preventing the sexual transmission of HIV infection and reduce the risk of other STDs.
 

 As for condoms being too modern, reports indicate many ancient cultures used some form of condoms, and a famous cave painting in Dordogne, France, shows a man practicing safe sex circa 11,000 B.C.
 

 In more contemporary times, rubber replaced animal intestines in condoms around the mid 1800s, and latex replaced rubber in the 1920s.
 

 Needless to say, there is nothing modern about condoms.
 

 Bottom line: Pence is an ignorant and dangerous religious extremist. By disseminating false and misleading information about condoms, Pence demonstrates that he is willing to endanger the health and welfare of young people in order to promote his demented, right-wing, conservative Christian, puritanical agenda."
208,snopes91,0,http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/06/10/gop-senator-david-perdue-jokes-about-praying-for-obama-s-death.html,GOP Senator David Perdue Jokes About Praying for Obamas Death,"At a major event for conservative Christians this morning, a Republican senator joked about praying for President Obamas days to be short.
 

 Sen. David Perdue, a freshman senator from Georgia, opened his remarks at the Faith & Freedom Coalitions Road to Majority conference by encouraging attendees to pray for President Obama. But, he added in a joking tone, they need to pray for him in a very specific way: We should pray for him like Psalms 109:8 says: Let his days be few, and let another have his office, the senator said, smiling wryly.
 

 The crowd chuckled and he moved on with his address.
 

 The rest of that passage, which Perdue did not recite, reads, May his children be fatherless and his wife a widow. May his children be wandering beggars; may they be driven from their ruined homes.
 

 The psalm is a pointed, lengthy death wish for one of Davids enemies.
 

 Let the creditor seize all that he has, and let strangers plunder his labor. Let there be none to extend mercy to him, nor let there be any to favor his fatherless children. Let his posterity be cut off, and in the generation following let their name be blotted out, it continues.
 

 Perdues joke drew immediate criticism. Adam Jentleson, a spokesman for Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, tweeted, Republican Senator David Perdue is praying for President Obama to die. This is why Trump is the GOP nominee.
 

 As the Washington Posts Dave Weigel pointed out, conservatives have long invoked this verse in the yearning for an end to Obamas days in office. A Christian Science Monitor report from November 16, 2009, detailed the popularity of bumper stickers that read simply, Pray for Obama: Psalm 109:8.
 

 Its protected speech, but its clearly offensive, the Anti-Defamation Leagues Deborah Lauter said at the time.
 

 The Road to Majority conference brings together top leaders in the social-conservative world, as well as prominent elected Republicans. Shortly after Perdues speech, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and top Trump adviser Sen. Jeff Sessions spoke. Donald Trump will keynote the event later today.
 

 UPDATE: After publication, Perdue spokeswoman Caroline Vanvick gave this statement to Bloombergs Sahil Kapur:
 

 Senator Perdue said we are called to pray for our country, for our leaders, and for our president. He in no way wishes harm towards our president and everyone in the room understood that. However, we should add the media to our prayer list because they are pushing a narrative to create controversy and that is exactly what the American people are tired of."

Twitter user @Piznack, one of multiple people to share videos of the strange scene, tweeted: “Y’all my family in the Bahamas said Irma sucked up all the water. There’s literally no water. The beach and ocean are gone.”
He tweeted a follow-up video that showed how the water had retreated at a beach in Long Island, Bahamas. Angela Fritz, The Washington Post’s deputy weather editor, confirmed this phenomenon is real and may occur during extremely powerful hurricanes such as Irma. The storm is so powerful, it can essentially change the shape of the ocean, Fritz said.
“Basically, Hurricane Irma is so strong and its pressure is so low, it’s sucking water from its surroundings into the core of the storm,” Fritz wrote.
“In the center of the storm, where there is extreme low pressure, water is drawn upward. Low pressure is basically a sucking mechanism — it sucks the air into it, and when it’s really low, it can change the shape of the surface of the ocean. As the storm draws water toward the center, it gets pulled away from the surroundings.”
Wayne Neely, a forecaster with the Bahamas’ Department of Meteorology, warned residents of Long Island and Exuma, where water had also reportedly receded from the beaches, to be careful as the ocean returned back to high levels.
“Care must be taken in this case because the water often returns with even greater fury,” Neely said in a Facebook post explaining the phenomenon. People who had seen the water recede in the Bahamas on Friday said the water returned the next day.
Irma ripped through the Caribbean Sea and parts of the Atlantic Ocean earlier this week. It is expected to make landfall in Florida early Sunday morning. So far, the storm has killed at least 22 people and displaced thousands more.
Below are more images of the ocean disappearing from beaches in the Bahamas as far as the horizon.

210,snopes93,0,http://edition.cnn.com/2000/NATURE/08/18/urban.interface/index.html,Western wildfires often battled in the front yard,"As the wildfires continue to burn in Montana's Bitteroot Valley, nearly a quarter of a million acres of the Bitteroot National Forest have already burned and more than 50 homes have been destroyed.

Nearly 2,000 firefighters are battling the blazes and more are on the way. Although these are forest fires, crews often find themselves working in people's front yards. In recent years, thousands of families have built homes just outside the national forest.

Authorities call this meeting of residence and forest an ""urban interface."" ""This urban interface does not deal with large communities, but it deals with a lot of homes that are scattered and that makes it even more difficult, "" said Sonny Lasalle with the U.S. Forest Service.

Helicopters have dropped thousands of buckets of water to keep flames away from homes and air tankers have made countless trips to coat structures with flame retardant. Twenty-man crews have been working around the clock digging fire lines and lighting backfires, to create a barrier between the blazes and the houses.

""Most of the resources this past week have gone to the structure protection. We've lost some structures in the incident but we've saved quite a few more than we've lost,"" according to Bob Summerfield, a fire information officer with the U.S. Forest Service.

""We've had engines and crews out putting the bulk of their effort into taking measures around homes, building fire lines, setting up sprinkler systems and foaming houses to protect those structures,"" Summerfield said.

Hundreds of residents have been evacuated and special crews have moved in to try to protect the homes. But some houses nestled in the trees are impossible to protect. Firefighters say there are things people can do to make their homes more fire-resistant.

""The main thing is to get some vegetation away from your house, use building materials that are less fire prone and then have a little bit of a lawn. I know we all don't like to mow grass but have a little bit of lawn or a rock garden -- something that won't burn,"" said Fire Information Officer Bobby Kitchens. As the flames approach their neighborhoods, some residents have resorted to hiring professional loggers to cut the trees around the homes. They've learned a lesson from the less fortunate.

Darby Mayor Forest Hayes offered this insight: ""Our forests are born in fire and they die in fire. Now we have homes that are back in areas that have for centuries have burned on a regular basis. This year we have a fire that's going to change the way people live in this valley. It's unfortunate, but that's the bottom line.""

So, when the Eagle Creek fire, a 31,000-acre blaze burning near Portland, Oregon, encroached on the nearby Beacon Rock Golf Course, things didn't exactly grind to a halt.
Staff at the golf course -- located in Washington state, just across the Columbia River from the fire -- posted pictures on Wednesday to Facebook of golfers carrying on as the massive wildfire raged through trees on a nearby hillside. ""Our golfers are committed to finishing the round!"" read one post, which features three golfers pushing ahead with their game as two other people on the course look at the fire.
As it heralded its golfers, Beacon Rock also took stock of the gravity of the situation. In another post, showing a view of the course and the fire from the clubhouse, the staff said it's ""thinking of how many people will be affected"" by the blaze, which has forced hundreds of residents to evacuate.

River provides a buffer

Taken Monday evening, the photos' and captions' apparent lack of panic owes to the fact that the Columbia River provides a buffer between the fire and the golf course, Mark Mayfield, Beacon Rock's operations manager, told CNN. ""The fire was a mile and a half away,"" he said.
Local reaction to the fire photos has been a mix of wonder and confusion, he said.
""Some people said, 'Wow, it's awesome,' while others wondered, 'How could they keep playing golf?'"" Mayfield said.
By Thursday, no one was playing the course because of all the smoke from the fires, though Beacon Rock's restaurant was still open, he said.

Fire not yet contained

The fast-moving fire, which started Saturday and merged with the nearby Indian Creek fire, has not been contained, Oregon Gov. Kate Brown said. It's burning east of Portland, at the Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area, according to an online update by the National Wildfire Coordinating Group.
Oregon State Police say a teenager from Vancouver, Washington, is believed to have started the fire while he and some friends may have been using fireworks. The 15-year-old hasn't been arrested or publicly identified, state police said.
The golf course photos are reminiscent of the photo out of Canada that went viral earlier this summer of a man cutting his grass while a tornado churned away in the background."
212,snopes95,0,https://www.vox.com/2017/8/31/16236280/trump-obamacare-outreach-ads,Trump is slashing Obamacare’s advertising budget by 90%,"The White House will also cut the in-person outreach program by $23 million. The Trump administration plans to deeply cut Obamacare outreach and advertising, officials announced Thursday. They will reduce Obamacare advertising spending 90 percent, from the $100 million that the Obama administration spent last year to $10 million this year, and cut the budget for the in-person enrollment program by 41 percent.

Taken together, this represents a 72 percent cut to efforts to enroll eligible Americans into health law programs.

Administration officials cited “diminishing returns” from outreach activities. In a phone call with reporters, they said that most Americans already know about the Affordable Care Act. They plan to make the deepest cuts to the enrollment workers who have signed up few health law enrollees. Obamacare advocates, however, worry that these type of budget cuts will be devastating to the law, making it difficult for potential enrollees to learn about the benefits.

""The surest way to kill the exchanges is to keep them a secret,"" says Timothy Jost, a consumer advocate at the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. ""Sick people will find them, but getting younger and healthier people enrolled is the problem.""

Trump administration will cut advertising from $100 million to $10 million
There are two main ways the federal government has typically handled Obamacare outreach: with advertisements and in-person assistance. The Trump administration will significantly scale back both of these activities, spending millions less on each program. The Affordable Care Act’s advertising budget has paid for digital messaging, television ads and radio spots. Officials at Health and Human Services estimated that the Obama administration spent $100 million on advertising last year.

This year, the Trump administration will spend $10 million on advertising nationwide. To put that number in context, California is planning to spend $111.5 million on health law advertising in its state alone.

Health and Human Services officialssaid they thought the ads weren’t working as well in the health law’s fourth year.

“People are aware of Obamacare and the exchanges, they are aware they can sign up,” the second HHS official said. (A spokesperson requested that reporters refer to the officials as Health and Human Service Official 1, 2, and 3. When asked why their names could not be used, the spokesperson said “It’s just for briefing purposes.”) “The Obama administration doubled spending on advertising and saw a 5 percent decline in enrollment. Despite a doubled budget, there are diminishing returns.”

The decline in health law enrollment, however, occurred in late January, around the moment the Trump administration abruptly cancelled $5 million in advertisements after taking office.

When pressed by a reporter, officials said they had not done any studies of the efficacy of enrollment advertising or whether public awareness is indeed quite high.

“We haven’t done a specific study related to the public awareness of the program,” the third HHS official said. “I think most Americans are aware of the program at this point in time.”

There is not a large body of research on Affordable Care Act advertising, but what has been done correlates more advertising with higher sign-up rates. A 2017 study published in the journal Health Affairs shows that “counties exposed to higher volumes of local insurance advertisements during the first open enrollment period experienced larger reductions in their uninsurance rates than other counties.”

Consumer advocates, meanwhile, argue that this is the exact moment when advertising is needed, given all the uncertainty over the health law’s future the recent Congressional debate has created.

“This is actually a time when we need more assistance because of the confusion around what the future of the ACA is, whether the mandate is being enforced, what plan options are,” says Elizabeth Hagan, associate director of coverage initiatives at Families USA.

In-person assistance will receive a $23 million budget cut
The Obama administration spent $62.5 million in 2016 providing grants to non-profits and health clinics to help Americans sign up for health coverage. This “navigator” program paid enrollment workers to assist with enrollment, and advertise the open enrollment period to their community (through things like phone calls and health fairs).

The Trump administration will reduce the navigator program’s budget to $36 million. It will focus its budget cuts on the navigator grantees that have fallen short of their enrollment goals. A navigator grantee, for example, who only hit 30 percent of its enrollment goal this year will get just 30 percent of its expected budget for next year (no grantees will be defunded entirely — the first HHS official said they’d set a floor of $10,000 for all participants).

Groups that outperformed their enrollment goal — who enrolled 110 percent of expected enrollees, for example — will not get a bonus for their work.

“No, that is not part of the methodology,” the second HHS official told reporters.

The HHS officials argued that the navigator program has been ineffective. Despite its multimillion-dollar budget, they estimate it has only signed up 81,426 Obamacare enrollees. The first HHS official cited the case of one Obamacare navigator group that received a $200,000 grant but only signed one person up.

Hagan argued that the navigators have an important function beyond the in-person sign-ups. They attend health fairs, hand out flyers in the community, and make phone calls to enrollees reminding them to re-enroll. Those activities may be missed by the Trump administration’s methodology, which relies on a navigator’s ID number being entered onto the application (which might not happen in a case where an enrollees seeks in-person advice, for example, but finished the sign-up process at home).

“They may be helping one consumer with an application but they’re letting their families know, and letting their friends know,” Hagan says.

These changes come amid other Trump administration decisions that could lower health law enrollment. HHS announced this spring that it would cut the open enrollment period in half, from 90 days this year to 45 days next year. Consumer advocates expect these changes will depress enrollment significantly.

“The need for in person assistance is more profound now than the first open enrollment period,” Hagan says.

Communication is critical during any emergency, but whenever a natural disaster strikes, it's often unreliable. Congested cell phone networks and damaged infrastructure can make it difficult for rescue workers to disseminate information, and for loved ones to get in touch with one another. A new app aims to change that.

The makers of FireChat, a smartphone app for offline messaging, have today announced a new app that allows rescue agencies to send alerts even when cellular networks and internet connections are unavailable. Called FireChat Alerts, the app uses peer-to-peer networking technology, known as mesh networking, to push alerts to smartphone users within a given time frame and geographic area. Those within affected areas will receive the alerts through the FireChat app, which will then automatically store and forward them to other FireChat users who are within range (typically about 200 feet in urban areas). Christophe Daligault, chief marketing officer at Open Garden, says the app was designed as a simple way for organizations to provide information ""to the people who need it most."" ""What's interesting about this approach is that it doesn't require any new hardware or even any difficult configuration,"" Daligault said in a phone interview this week. ""It's just software, which means that it can be easily deployed and can scale infinitely. There's no need for hardware because the hardware's already there.""

FireChat first gained popularity at festivals like Burning Man, though it has also seen spikes in activity during protests, elections, and natural disasters, when cellular networks may be blocked, congested, or damaged. The app creates mesh networks by linking phones via Bluetooth and peer-to-peer Wi-Fi, with each device functioning as a node in the network. The mesh network strengthens as the number of users increases, making it ideal for densely populated cities like Manila. Since launching in 2014, FireChat has been downloaded more than 7 million times. Open Garden, the San Francisco-based startup that created FireChat, says its new app can be used by government organizations, rescue workers, and media organizations to send both text and visual information during emergencies. The company developed FireChat Alerts as part of a pilot program in the Philippines — which sees about 20 typhoons a year — and in collaboration with the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA).

Rescue workers could use FireChat Alerts to send messages from within an affected area with zero internet connectivity, though those on the periphery could also receive information over the internet and automatically transmit over the mesh network to disconnected users. Daligault says that in a typical urban area with 5 percent penetration, it would take about 20 minutes for a message to reach every FireChat user; in densely populated areas like Manila, it would only take ""a couple of minutes."" Other organizations have used mesh networking to connect people during protests, when governments have shut down internet access, or to provide connectivity to underserved neighborhoods. Marco Di Felice, a professor of computer science at the University of Bologna, says mesh networking holds a lot of promise for connecting people ""in situations where cellular infrastructure is down,"" though he says there are some drawbacks. The technology wouldn't be able to reach people in rural areas when disasters bring down networks, and people would have to be using the same app to communicate.

""You need to have a lot of people on the app, otherwise you will try to send a message and no one will receive it,"" says Di Felice, who has studied the potential for mesh networks in emergency communications. ""And this is not trivial.""

Open Garden has released an SDK that would allow government agencies to incorporate the same functionality in their own apps, and Daligault acknowledges the importance of having enough users on the same platform.

""You want to make sure that everyone has [the app] before disasters happen,"" he says. ""In the case of hurricanes and typhoons you get early warnings, in the case of earthquakes, not so much... When it's too late, it's too late."""
214,snopes97,0,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/08/30/the-terrifying-science-behind-floating-fire-ant-colonies-and-how-to-destroy-them/,The terrifying science behind floating fire ant colonies — and how to destroy them,"In addition to widespread suffering and devastation, Hurricane Harvey has brought a plague of floating fire ants to the Houston region.

“Floodwaters will not drown fire ants,” explains Paul Nester, an extension specialist at Texas A&M, in a pamphlet titled “Flooding and Fire Ants: Protecting Yourself and Your Family.” Instead, entire colonies of the aggressive biting insects — eggs, larvae and all — will “emerge from the soil, form a loose ball, float, and flow with the water until they reach a dry area or object they can crawl up on.”

For the uninitiated, a fire ant resembles a regular ant in roughly the same way a wolf resembles a golden retriever. They're aggressive, territorial and venomous. Among vulnerable individuals, their stings can be fatal. “Most people hate fire ants without reservation,” Florida State University entomologist Walter Tschinkel wrote in a book about the insects in 2006. Here's what a fire ant raft looks like, in a brief video captured earlier this week by Houston Chronicle reporter Mike Hixenbaugh: The things that look like grains of white rice on the top of the raft are larvae and pupae — future ants, essentially. By bringing them along, the colonies help ensure their survival once they reach high ground.

Some areas around Houston are reportedly seeing dozens, if not hundreds, of these colonies come ashore in the wake of the flooding there. Researchers have extensively studied this behavior to find out how, exactly, the ants do it. A 2011 paper by David Hu and colleagues at Georgia Tech found that when you drop a clump of fire ants on a surface of water, they will cling to each other and distribute themselves into a pancake-shaped disc.

Here's a sped-up video of roughly 8,000 ants demonstrating this behavior. The ants can do this because their bodies partially repel water, or, in scientific terms, they are “hydrophobic.” When water comes in contact with a fire ant, it beads up into droplets, the same way it does on a car window treated with Rain-X.

From Hu's paper, here's a fire ant demonstrating his hydrophobic properties by carrying around a ball of water on his head. “An advantage of being hydrophobic is the ability of ants and semiaquatic insects to trap a plastron layer of air around their bodies, without which they would sink,” Hu and his colleagues write. In other words if you try to sink an ant, its hydrophobic body will trap an air bubble with it as it submerges.

Here's a photo of a fire ant in Hu's lab, held under water by a thread, with an air bubble attached to its thorax. These trapped bubbles allow ants at the bottom of their flotillas to survive being partially submerged. If one ant is mildly hydrophobic, an entire colony of them is even more so. This makes a floating ant flotilla particularly hard to sink, as this video demonstrates: If you push down on a fire ant raft, surface tension pushes the water away with it. (Meanwhile, angry ants will start crawling up the thing you're prodding them with.) If you somehow succeed in pushing the raft under, the ants will take a massive air bubble down with them, as this video demonstrates. These properties allow a colony of fire ants to survive on the water for weeks. But that doesn't mean they're invincible. In fact, they have an Achilles' heel: dish soap.

Spray a bit of soapy water on an ant raft and it will break apart and begin sinking almost instantaneously. “As soon as ants become even slightly soapy, they immediately release their grip with each other, which is shown by the disintegration of the raft and its submergence underwater,” Hu and his colleagues found. The soapy water not only makes the ants unable to grab their neighbors, it also prevents the formation of air bubbles around a submerged ant. An experiment conducted in the 1990s found that the application of a mildly soapy solution kills off anywhere from 80 to 90 percent of a floating ant colony within 10 minutes. Dish soap isn't a large-scale solution for dealing with floating fire ants. “It only spreads so much and it also [has] an effect on helpful organisms like water striders, which eat pests on the water surface,” Hu explained in an email.

Spraying an individual floating colony with soapy water also requires getting close to both the water and the ants, which should be avoided at nearly all costs in an extreme flooding situation.

Still, if you are otherwise safe, dry and have easy access to both floating ants and soapy water, “it does make a cool gee-whiz experiment,” Hu said."
215,snopes98,0,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/03/us/politics/taco-trucks-on-every-corner-trump-supporters-anti-immigration-warning.html,‘Taco Trucks on Every Corner’: Trump Supporter’s Anti-Immigration Warning,"“My culture is a very dominant culture, and it’s imposing and it’s causing problems. If you don’t do something about it, you’re going to have taco trucks on every corner.”

That was Marco Gutierrez, founder of the group Latinos for Trump, issuing a dire warning to the United States in an interview with Joy Reid on MSNBC on Thursday night.

America’s response? Mmm, tacos! 

Though some sympathized with the message, Mr. Gutierrez’s comments elicited a largely sarcastic backlash on social media. #TacosOnEveryCorner surged to the top of Twitter’s list of trending topics, where it remained on Friday morning.

The comment came at a sensitive time for Donald J. Trump’s presidential campaign. Several members of his Hispanic advisory council withdrew their support this week, saying they had been led to believe that Mr. Trump was shifting his hard-line tone on immigration.

“He used us as props,” said Jacob Monty, who resigned after Mr. Trump reverted to his fiery language on immigration Wednesday night after returning from Mexico, where he had struck a more measured, even subdued, tone.

During the interview with Mr. Gutierrez, Ms. Reid quickly interjected, saying, “I don’t even know what that means, and I’m almost afraid to ask.”

Mr. Gutierrez explained:

“We are a culture that — we have a lot of good things that we bring to the United States, but we also have problems.”

Mr. Gutierrez might have spared himself some of the ridicule had he recognized America’s longstanding love affair with Mexican food. Nearly 25 years ago, salsa surpassed ketchup in retail store sales, and some would argue that Mexican food has already conquered American cuisine.

Mr. Trump, for his part, has long been accused of being tone-deaf in his Hispanic outreach, including, for example, in his posting of a photo of himself and a taco bowl on May 5, proclaiming, “I love Hispanics!”

From the start, his hard-line approach to immigration has alienated Hispanics, and his accusation that Mexico was sending rapists across the border did nothing to tame the controversy.

“When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best,” Mr. Trump said in announcing his campaign in June 2015. “They’re not sending you. They’re not sending you. They’re sending people that have lots of problems, and they’re bringing those problems with us. They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.”

Later that day, he added that, to keep out undocumented immigrants, he would “build a great wall, and nobody builds walls better than me,” a promise repeated numerous times since, including in Phoenix on Wednesday.

As a Trump surrogate, Mr. Gutierrez is not the first to offend. The African-American pastor Mark Burns has said that Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee, panders to African-Americans and endorses black genocide. He also apologized for retweeting images of Mrs. Clinton in blackface.

Some observers saw the taco truck remarks as code words to mine the racial resentments of white Americans.

Others reacted with humor:"

Kelly, a former U.S. diplomat who served in Mexico from 2004 to 2006, teaches at the Sanford School of Public Policy at Duke University.

In a scene that would have given Donald Trump heart palpitations, 200 flag-waving Mexican troops breached the U.S. border outside Laredo, Tex., 10 years ago and advanced unopposed up Interstate 35 to San Antonio.

It was the first time a Mexican army had marched on San Antonio since 1836 when Gen. Santa Ana massacred besieged Texas independence fighters at the Alamo.

This time, however, the Mexican soldiers were on a relief mission to feed tens of thousands of homeless and hungry Americans displaced by Hurricane Katrina. Setting up camp at a former Air Force base outside San Antonio, they distributed potable water, medical supplies and 7,000 hot meals a day for the next three weeks.

If this doesn’t sound like the Mexico you’ve been hearing about lately — the one that has been ripping America off, the one that sends rapists and criminals across the border — you might want to consider this little-known gesture of humanity from our abused southern neighbor as you think about Katrina 10 years later.

I was serving as the No. 2 at the U.S. Embassy in Mexico City in August 2005 when Katrina made landfall on the Gulf Coast. The storm’s track posed no danger to Mexico, and we followed events like most expatriate Americans — aghast, but at a distance.

But not Mexicans. They were watching the same scenes of floating corpses and botched relief efforts in New Orleans. My chief contact at Mexico’sForeign Ministry called to say the Mexican army had two field kitchens that could feed storm victims who had made their way to Texas, he said, and the navy had two ships that could help with cleanup efforts in New Orleans.

I told my contact the offer was very generous, noted that many countries had offered assistance, and added that the State Department and the Federal Emergency Management Agency would decide which offers to accept. He said it was too late for that. The convoy had already left Mexico City on its way to the border, and the ships were ready to steam from Veracruz.

To put this in context, the United States likes to think of itself as the country that does the helping, as we had done when Mexico City was struck by a devastating earthquake in 1985. But few had contemplated the possibility that Mexico would be coming to help us.

The next 48 hours were a mad scramble to get Washington to say yes, to figure out how to admit more than 200 military personal without passports or visas, and to recognize that the Mexican army, traditionally one of the most nationalistic and anti-American elements in the Mexican government, was making an extraordinary gesture.

It worked. The 45-vehicle convoy crossed the border at Laredo at dawn on Sept. 8 and arrived in San Antonio later that day. The only glitch was that the USDA would not allow the Mexicans to serve the beef they had brought because they couldn’t prove it had been produced in a mad-cow-free facility. Undeterred — and un-insulted — the Mexicans bought their beef locally.

By the time their mission in San Antonio ended Sept. 25, the Mexicans had served 170,000 meals, helped distribute more than 184,000 tons of supplies and conducted more than 500 medical consultations.

Mexican sailors also assisted with clearing downed branches and other storm debris in Biloxi, Miss., where they posed for photos with President George W. Bush, who thanked them for their help.

Nobody was more surprised by this humanitarian mission than the Mexican military itself. Perhaps pumped up by its unexpected display of competence and compassion, even for a normally haughty northern neighbor, the Mexican army became far less defensive , and more willing to cooperate with its U.S. counterpart.

Disasters such as Hurricane Katrina, or the spectacle of U.S. presidential politics, often force to the surface the true character of the players. The Mexicans proved they were neighbors we can count on. One can only speculate how Trump would have handled the Mexican invasion had he been president. Would he have considered the visa-free Mexican soldiers illegal immigrants? Would he dispatch rape kits to San Antonio-area hospitals?

We should try to answer those questions soon. Because hurricane season is again upon us. And you never know when you are going to need a friendly neighbor, and a hot meal."
